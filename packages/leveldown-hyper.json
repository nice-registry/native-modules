It extends the LevelDOWN api with functionality to do live backups. This README only documents the `liveBackup()` method. For a complete reference we refer to [`LevelDOWN`](https://github.com/Level/leveldown).\n\nLevelDOWN can be considered an upstream repository to LevelDOWNHyper and any common logic and bug fixes will be merged from upstream into this repository.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n### liveBackup(name, callback)\n<code>liveBackup()</code> is an instance method on an existing database object, used to make a live backup of the current state of the database.\n\nThe `name` parameter is a `String`. A successful live backup will result in a backup folder named `backup-:name` inside the `location` folder of the current database.\n\nThe `callback` function will be called with no arguments when a live backup was successful, or with a single `error` argument if the backup operation failed for any reason.\n\nCommunity\n---------\n\nLevelDOWNHyper is an **OPEN Open Source Project**.
