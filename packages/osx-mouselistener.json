We can talk directly with the hardware so this should work regardless of which state the rest of the system is in.\n\n## Usage example\n{{example.js}}\nWrites click information to console\n\n## Installation\nvia npm\n```\nnpm install osx-mouselistener\n```\n\n## Tests\nSorry, I didn't feel like it. It's a POC\n\n## Why?\nWhen I was writing a osx-keylogger POC I was intrigued by the possibility of listening for mouse clicks. Would it be easier? I was determined to find out.\n\n## License\nMIT, see LICENSE file\n","created":"2017-07-09T14:36:54.460Z","modified":"2017-07-09T14:51:03.375Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"justzisguy","email":"magnus.weinberg@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"justzisguy","email":"magnus.weinberg@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"osx-mouselistener","_nodeVersion":"8.0.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/osx-mouselistener-1.0.1.tgz_1499611862526_0.047023367835208774"},"_npmUser":{"name":"justzisguy","email":"magnus.weinberg@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"5.0.0","_rev":"2-bab4c09cc26bae80e7b0227b9404c6d5","author":{"name":"Magnus Weinberg","email":"magnus.weinberg@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/JustZisGuy/osx-mouselistener/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.1"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-UqiJUw8Knj127OJ6SYfk4/kDvvheVqej1kniYi8YDPHUHl1GxshArFnoNkGv4Tv4lfYyzuzbxa1Vjssq6uB2Xw==","shasum":"3fb04a09c7e91ee6683c3e219c4dd687025a14c8","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/osx-mouselistener/-/osx-mouselistener-1.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"justzisguy","email":"magnus.weinberg@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.librarity.md","time":{"modified":"2017-07-09T14:51:03.375Z","created":"2017-07-09T14:36:54.460Z","1.0.0":"2017-07-09T14:36:54.460Z","1.0.1":"2017-07-09T14:51:03.375Z"}}}
