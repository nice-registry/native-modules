If you instead have the `nodejs` executable on Debian, you should install the [`nodejs-legacy`](https://packages.debian.org/sid/nodejs-legacy) package.\n\n## Installation\n\n 1. Clone [the grpc repository](https://github.com/grpc/grpc).\n 2. Follow the instructions in the `INSTALL` file in the root of that repository to install the C core library that this package depends on.\n 3. Run `npm install`.\n\nIf you install the gRPC C core library in a custom location, then you need to set some environment variables to install this library. The command will look like this:\n\n```sh\nCXXFLAGS=-I<custom location>/include LDFLAGS=-L<custom location>/lib npm install [grpc]\n```\n\n## Tests\n\nTo run the test suite, simply run `npm test` in the install location.\n\n## API\n\nThis library internally uses [ProtoBuf.js](https://github.com/dcodeIO/ProtoBuf.js), and some structures it exports match those exported by that library\n\nIf you require this module, you will get an object with the following members\n\n```javascript\nfunction load(filename)\n```\n\nTakes a filename of a [Protocol Buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) file, and returns an object representing the structure of the protocol buffer in the following way:\n\n - Namespaces become maps from the names of their direct members to those member objects\n - Service definitions become client constructors for clients for that service. They also have a `service` member that can be used for constructing servers.\n - Message definitions become Message constructors like those that ProtoBuf.js would create\n - Enum definitions become Enum objects like those that ProtoBuf.js would create\n - Anything else becomes the relevant reflection object that ProtoBuf.js would create\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction loadObject(reflectionObject)\n```\n\nReturns the same structure that `load` returns, but takes a reflection object from `ProtoBuf.js` instead of a file name.\n\n```javascript\nfunction buildServer(serviceArray)\n```\n\nTakes an array of service objects and returns a constructor for a server that handles requests to all of those services.\n\n\n```javascript\nstatus\n```\n\nAn object mapping status names to status code numbers.\n\n\n```javascript\ncallError\n```\n\nAn object mapping call error names to codes. This is primarily useful for tracking down certain kinds of internal errors.\n\n\n```javascript\nCredentials\n```\n\nAn object with factory methods for creating credential objects for clients.\n\n\n```javascript\nServerCredentials\n```\n\nAn object with factory methods fro creating credential objects for servers.\n","versions":[{"number":"0.9.0","date":"2015-07-23T21:17:45.501Z"},{"number":"0.9.1","date":"2015-07-23T21:22:14.516Z"}],"created":"2015-07-23T21:17:45.501Z","modified":"2015-07-23T21:22:14.516Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"cjhs","email":"jens.schmidt+c@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"cjhs","email":"jens.schmidt+c@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"cgrpc","_npmUser":{"name":"cjhs","email":"jens.schmidt+c@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.28","_rev":"1-675d877d7ee4d3de4d7a4e02d0b1cbd6","_shasum":"1617c73adb606d3a7ab305475577809578459da4","author":{"name":"Google Inc."},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"Michael Lumish","email":"mlumish@google.com"}],"directories":{"lib":"src","example":"examples"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.9.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"1617c73adb606d3a7ab305475577809578459da4","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/cgrpc/-/cgrpc-0.9.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"cjhs","email":"jens.schmidt+c@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-07-23T21:22:14.516Z","created":"2015-07-23T21:17:45.501Z","0.9.0":"2015-07-23T21:17:45.501Z","0.9.1":"2015-07-23T21:22:14.516Z"}}}
