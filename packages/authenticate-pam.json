It is used to provide remote network authentication that will skip any local only authentication methods like for example fingerprint reading.\n* Already mentioned utilization of libuv and node-gyp\n* Proper type checking in C++ code, it throws exception if bad types are given\n* In case of error it passes the error string containing both pam function and `pam_strerror()` results\n\nExample\n=========\n\nSimple usage\n------------\nDefault service_name for `pam_start(2)` is 'login'.\n\n```js\nvar pam = require('authenticate-pam');\npam.authenticate('myusername', 'mysecretpassword', function(err) {\n    if(err) {\n      console.log(err);\n    }\n    else {\n      console.log(\"Authenticated!\");\n    }\n  });\n```\n\nUsage with options:\n-------------------\nProper apps should provide their own service name. Sample services are located in `/etc/pam.d`.\nAs an example lookup a service name file for `sshd`.\nTo do proper network authentication you should also provide `remoteHost` key to the options argument. It will be passed to pam as `PAM_RHOST` (`pam_set_item(2)`)\n\n```js\nvar pam = require('authenticate-pam');\npam.authenticate('rush', 'mysecretpassword', function(err) {\n    if(err) {\n      console.log(err);\n    }\n    else {\n      console.log(\"Authenticated!\");\n    }\n}, {serviceName: 'myapp', remoteHost: 'localhost'});\n```\n    \nInstall\n-------------------\n`npm install authenticate-pam`\n","starsCount":3,"created":"2012-07-02T13:17:10.347Z","modified":"2016-11-22T03:07:04.091Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"rush","email":"rush@rushbase.net"},"owners":[{"name":"rush","email":"rush@rushbase.net"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"authenticate-pam","_nodeVersion":"6.2.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/authenticate-pam-1.0.2.tgz_1468168218007_0.32430037995800376"},"_npmUser":{"name":"rush","email":"rush@rushbase.net"},"_npmVersion":"3.9.3","_rev":"2-cb3b1d014c3cc46e5117954543511f4c","_shasum":"cb194d14eeae701ad85fa2aa65d458a172f1fdfd","author":{"name":"Damian Kaczmarek","email":"damian@codecharm.co.uk"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/RushPL/node-authenticate-pam/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"cb194d14eeae701ad85fa2aa65d458a172f1fdfd","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/authenticate-pam/-/authenticate-pam-1.0.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"rush","email":"rush@rushbase.net"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-11-22T03:07:04.091Z","created":"2012-07-02T13:17:10.347Z","0.1.0":"2012-07-02T13:17:12.389Z","0.1.1":"2013-01-05T12:34:53.106Z","0.1.2":"2013-01-06T00:52:24.077Z","0.1.3":"2013-04-01T21:25:17.478Z","0.2.0":"2014-02-08T00:54:48.551Z","0.2.1":"2014-04-01T11:58:24.664Z","0.2.2":"2014-05-26T14:15:59.394Z","1.0.0":"2015-11-19T21:26:02.448Z","1.0.1":"2016-04-29T19:42:06.625Z","1.0.2":"2016-07-10T16:30:20.532Z"},"users":{"developit":true,"kyasuda2003":true,"cxueqin":true}}}
