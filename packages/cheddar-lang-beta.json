But first, to clone the cheddar repository, use the following:\n\n```sh\n$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/cheddar-lang/Cheddar.git\n```\n\nAdditionally, when _syncinc_ your branch with the latest update to `develop`, use the following command to avoid merge commmits:\n\n```sh\n$ git rebase develop -X theirs\n```\n\nOnce your changes are ready to merge, submit a PR to the `develop` branch where it'll be reviewed and then merged if applicable\n\n## Manual Installation\n\nManual installation is simple. The only dependencies you must have are [git](https://git-scm.com) and [nodejs + npm](https://nodejs.org/en/). Additionally you should have [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (preferably GNU), but this comes by default on almost every *nix system.\n\n - First, refer to the \"Development\" section for cloning the Cheddar repository.\n\n - The next step is to install the dependencies with npm. An automatic build should trigger if dependencies are installed succesfully. Once this command is finished you should see a `dist/` directory created. If you don't, look for any errors in the installation.\n\n  ```bash\n$ npm install\n```\n\n - Manually building / testing\n\n  You can use `make` to run the build, test, and install tasks:\n  ```bash\n$ make         # Production Build\n$ make build   # Development Build\n$ make test    # Run tests\n```\n\n - Installing.\n\n  If you want to install the Cheddar CLI, you have some options. If you are doing a production installation, use `make install`. For all other cases use `./bin/install`; with this you can pass a `--method` argument to specify whether you'd like to install for yourself (`--method=alias`) or for everyone on your computer (`--method=path`, the default) which may require elevated privileges. With `--method=alias`, provide the location of your bashrc file or equivalent with the `--rcloc` flag (usually for *nix systems this is `~/.bashrc`, and for Mac this is `~/.bash_profile`). You may specify the installation path with `--method=path`, Cheddar installs the binary in `<path>/bin/cheddar` and `<path>/share/cheddar`; this defaults to `/usr/local`.\n","created":"2016-10-03T04:21:06.449Z","modified":"2016-12-23T22:03:33.149Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"vihanb","email":"contact@vihan.org"},"owners":[{"name":"vihanb","email":"contact@vihan.org"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"cheddar-lang-beta","_nodeVersion":"7.1.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/cheddar-lang-beta-1.0.5.tgz_1482530612894_0.8137689086142927"},"_npmUser":{"name":"vihanb","email":"contact@vihan.org"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.9","_rev":"2-9d523a68cd68d5c09355969f0c885181","_shasum":"4ff8610da02ea40f0954beb0858c9047948f06a6","author":{"name":"Vihan","email":"contact@vihan.org","url":"http://vihan.org/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/cheddar-lang/Cheddar/issues"},"directories":{"test":"test"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.5"},"dist":{"shasum":"4ff8610da02ea40f0954beb0858c9047948f06a6","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/cheddar-lang-beta/-/cheddar-lang-beta-1.0.5.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"vihanb","email":"contact@vihan.org"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-12-23T22:03:33.149Z","created":"2016-10-03T04:21:06.449Z","1.0.0-beta.52":"2016-10-03T04:21:06.449Z","1.0.0":"2016-10-03T04:23:40.265Z","1.0.5":"2016-12-23T22:03:33.149Z"}}}
