Windows binaries are available for\nthe 32 and 64 bit versions of NodeJS, io.js and electron.\n\n## Features\n\n * full support for all functions of the Logitech LED SDK\n * fallback compatibility layer for non-Windows operating systems -\n   if not on Windows the module just behaves like the\n   Logitech Gaming Software has been exited under Windows\n * works with node webkit\n\n## Usage\n\nThe module slightly changes the way data is sent to and\nreceived from the LED SDK functions. If you need to pass\nparameters you will have to use an object.\n\n### Example\n\n```javascript\n\nvar logiled = require('logiled');\n\n// always initialize the library first...\nlogiled.init();\n\n// note: you should wait a few milliseconds after initializing\n\n// store the current lighting for restoring it later...\nlogiled.saveCurrentLighting();\n\n// set color of all keys to black (LEDs off)\nlogiled.setLighting({\n    redPercentage:   0,\n    greenPercentage: 0,\n    bluePercentage:  0\n});\n\n// ... wait a moment to see the effect\n\n// set color of ESC key to blue\nlogiled.setLightingForKeyWithKeyName({\n    keyName: logiled.KeyName.ESC, \n    redPercentage: 0,\n    greenPercentage: 0,\n    bluePercentage: 100\n});\n\n// ... wait a moment to see the effect\n\n// restore the lighting to the state it was saved earlier...\nlogiled.restoreLighting();\n\n// finally free the ressources again...\nlogiled.shutdown();\n\n```\n\n## Building\n\nThis project features precompiled binaries for nodeJS, io.js and electron.\n\nTo compile the extension yourself you will need to get Microsoft Visual Studio\nor the Microsoft Build Tools. To build logiled yourself, enter the module\nfolder and run:\n\n```\n$ npm i\n$ npm run configure\n$ npm run build\n```\n\nAll subsequent builds only need `npm run build`\n\nYou can confirm everything built correctly by [running the test suite](#to-run-tests).\n\n### Node-Webkit\n\nThere are no prebuilt binaries for node-webkit (nw.js) but you can compile logiled\nwith `nw-gyp`. Every logiled release will at least be tested against the most recent\nversion of node-webkit.\n\n### To run tests:\n\nRun checks against every API function a/k/a funny blinking demo.\n\n```\n$ npm test\n```\n\n### Furter Information\n\nRefer to the Logitech LED SDK documentation\nin the _PDF_-File located at `LED/Doc/LogitechGamingLEDSDK.pdf`\nafter building the module for the first time.\n\nVisit the [LOGITECH G DEVELOPER LAB](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/developers).\n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2017 Paul Bottin <paul.bottin+git@gmail.com>\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification,\nare permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1.
