Is done in C++11 to make use of object oriented design.\n\n###Why \n\n- Because Java have very good ecosystem of libraries like PDFBox, iText, Solr, etc.., all mature and useful.\n- The objective is to create wrappers around the library you want and use it in your Node app.\n- Easing Node.js integration with legacy Java system. \n- Performance, comunication between JS and a JVM method is â‰ˆ<1ms.\n \n### Features \n  \n  - The JVM run in the same NodeJS process as a native add-on so comunication between each other is fast. \n  - Allow you to load jar/classes and use them inside NodeJS like Javascript objects literals.  \n  - The API can choose the right method giving a set of arguments, so it solves the method overloading in Java. [experimental].\n  - Exception handling, exception thrown by JVM are translated to Javascript [exception](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_errors.asp). \n  \n##### Multi-Thread\n  - You can send blocking Java calls to a background thread and assign a callback to continue when finished.\n  ![alt tag](https://github.com/cesarvr/Ella/blob/master/docs/ella_multi_thread.png) \n\n##### Performance\n  - This is part of the [LibJNI](https://github.com/cesarvr/JNI) project, but explain how the performance is achieved by using this *broker* class to hide the caching/reflection details to the object class, this server class can be easily replace by custom made or platform specific implementantion, you just need to implement the same method signature and thats it.\n  ![alt tag](https://github.com/cesarvr/Ella/blob/master/docs/design-diagram.png) \n \n### Things to be added soon. \n\t\n  - support to static classes.\n  - support to non-void constructor. \n  - support for java.lang.object derivatives args/return.\n \n \n### Supported types [for now] \n  - Primitive\n    - int\n    - java.lang.String \n    - double \n    - byte[] - to Buffer to handle binaries.\n\n  - Object [comming soon...]\n\n### Installation\n\nElla requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.\n\n```sh\n$ export JAVA_HOME=/jdk/location/     #finish with / is important here, there is a bug in the installer :(\n$ npm install ella\n```\n\n### Methods\n\n#### setClassPath ( path: string array, recursive: true)\n\npath: array, paths where to find the .jars/.class\n\nrecursive: true/false, if true look for jar/classes recursively. \n\n\nThis method allow us to configure the classpath,  \n\n```sh\n\tvar ella = require('ella');\n\tella.setClassPath(['/folder/with/.jars/.class', ...], true);  //if true flag, it will look recursively all jars/class. \n```\n\n\n\n#### getClassPath ( void )\n\nreturn the classpath configuration. \n\nThis method allow us to configure the classpath.\n\n```sh\n\tella.getClassPath();  //myjar1.jar:myjar2.jar   \n```\n\n\n#### start ( callback )\n\ncreate an JVM instance asynchronously.\n \ncallback(instance): function take as parameter an instance of the JVM. \n\nThis method allow us to configure the classpath.\n\n```sh\n\tella.start(function(vm){  /* do some work with vm */   })\n```\n\n\n\n#### vm.new (string qualified classname)\n\ngiven a classname create a new object.\n\n```sh\n\tvar stringBuffer = vm.new('java.lang.StringBuffer');\n\t\n\t// stringBuffer.append\n\t// stringBuffer.insert\n\t// stringBuffer.substring \n\t// ....\n```\n\n### sync call \n\nTo make an sync call just call the method.\n\n```sh\n\tstringBuffer.append('hello'); \n\tconsole.log(stringBuffer.toString() );  //hello. \n```\n\n\n### async call \n\nJust call the method as normal and add a function callback as an extra parameter this extra parameter transform the call to async. \n\n```sh\n\t\n\tvar pdf = vm.new('com.pdf.Library'); // method signature  byte[] createPDF(string); \n\t\n\tvar buffer = pdf.createPDF('my_blocking.pdf');   // this call will block the interpreter in this position. \n\t\n\t// the addition of an anonymous function make all jvm->js-method async.\n\tpdf.createPDF('my_async.pdf', function(buffer){  /* do some work with buffer */ }); // non-blocking call.\n\t\n\t//js code.......\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","created":"2016-05-08T19:31:03.366Z","modified":"2016-06-19T23:02:04.219Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"cvaldezr","email":"cvaldezrx@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"cvaldezr","email":"cvaldezrx@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"ella","_nodeVersion":"4.4.5","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/ella-1.5.1.tgz_1466377321599_0.4769786384422332"},"_npmUser":{"name":"cvaldezr","email":"cvaldezrx@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.15.5","_rev":"1-a4287f2767398433da126337a7b35501","_shasum":"264c0cabfd4bdbfacdf918b6f966ad5e44ab61ee","author":{"name":"cvaldezr"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.5.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"264c0cabfd4bdbfacdf918b6f966ad5e44ab61ee","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/ella/-/ella-1.5.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"cvaldezr","email":"cvaldezrx@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"Readme.md","time":{"modified":"2016-06-19T23:02:04.219Z","created":"2016-05-08T19:31:03.366Z","1.0.0":"2016-05-08T19:31:03.366Z","1.0.1":"2016-05-08T19:37:14.173Z","1.0.2":"2016-05-08T19:40:39.232Z","1.0.3":"2016-05-08T19:45:50.563Z","1.0.4":"2016-05-08T19:48:19.460Z","1.0.5":"2016-05-08T19:56:31.730Z","1.0.6":"2016-05-08T23:13:20.846Z","1.0.7":"2016-05-08T23:21:11.045Z","1.0.8":"2016-05-08T23:40:59.161Z","1.0.9":"2016-05-08T23:44:15.151Z","1.1.0":"2016-05-10T09:04:57.888Z","1.1.1":"2016-05-10T21:07:17.923Z","1.1.2":"2016-05-11T18:54:30.957Z","1.5.0":"2016-05-29T18:52:56.489Z","1.5.1":"2016-06-19T23:02:04.219Z"}}}
