Weinberger of AT&T Bell Labs.\n> The book Compilers (Principles, Techniques and Tools) by Aho, Sethi and Ulman,\n> recommends the use of hash functions that employ the hashing methodology found\n> in this particular algorithm.\n\n> ### ELF Hash Function\n> Similar to the PJW Hash function, but tweaked for 32-bit processors.\n> Its the hash function widely used on most UNIX systems.\n\n> ### BKDR Hash Function\n> This hash function comes from Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie's book \"The C Programming Language\".\n> It is a simple hash function using a strange set of possible seeds which all constitute a pattern of\n> 31....31...31 etc, it seems to be very similar to the DJB hash function.\n\n> ### SDBM Hash Function\n> This is the algorithm of choice which is used in the open source SDBM project. The hash function\n> seems to have a good over-all distribution for many different data sets. It seems to work well in\n> situations where there is a high variance in the MSBs of the elements in a data set.\n\n> ### DJB Hash Function\n> An algorithm produced by Professor Daniel J. Bernstein and shown first to the world on the usenet\n> newsgroup comp.lang.c. It is one of the most efficient hash functions ever published.\n\n> ### DEK Hash Function\n> An algorithm proposed by Donald E. Knuth in The Art Of Computer Programming Volume 3,\n> under the topic of sorting and search chapter 6.4.\n\n> ### AP Hash Function\n> An algorithm produced by Arash Partow.\n\n> ### BP Hash Function\n> That code converts a (7-bit) ASCII string of at most (4 or 9) characters into a unique (32- or 64-)bit integer,\n> depending on the platform.  If more characters are given, the first n-(5 or 10) characters are ignored,\n> the low (4 or 1) bits of the next character are used, and the last (4 or 9) characters are used in full.\n> The code does not use the length of the string, so leading null characters are ignored.\n\n> ### FNV Hash Function\n> The basis of the FNV hash algorithm was taken from an idea sent as reviewer comments to the IEEE\n> POSIX P1003.2 committee by Glenn Fowler and Phong Vo back in 1991.\n\n> ### MurmurHash3\n> MurmurHash is a non-cryptographic hash function suitable for general hash-based lookup.It was created by Austin Appleby in 2008.It comes in 3 variants - a 32-bit version that targets low latency for hash table use and two 128-bit versions for generating unique identifiers for large blocks of data, one each for x86 and x64 platforms.\n\n## Install\n```\n$npm install node-hashes --save\n```\n\n## Usage\n```js\nvar hashes = require('node-hashes');\nvar ret = hashes.RSHash('foo');\n```\n\n```js\nvar hashes = require('node-hashes');\nvar seed = 32;\nvar ret = hashes.MurmurHash3_x86_128('foo', seed);\nfor (var i=0; i<ret.length; i++) {\n    console.info(ret[i]);\n}\n```\n\n## Benchmarks\n\n> - RsHash(key) x 2,146,582 ops/sec ±0.36% (93 runs sampled)\n> - JSHash(key) x 2,182,381 ops/sec ±0.35% (92 runs sampled)\n> - PJWHash(key) x 1,926,879 ops/sec ±0.30% (93 runs sampled)\n> - ELFHash(key) x 1,891,659 ops/sec ±0.38% (90 runs sampled)\n> - BKDRHash(key) x 1,857,905 ops/sec ±0.64% (91 runs sampled)\n> - ELFHash(key) x 1,894,290 ops/sec ±0.34% (89 runs sampled)\n> - SDBMHash(key) x 1,912,925 ops/sec ±0.54% (90 runs sampled)\n> - DJBHash(key) x 2,030,426 ops/sec ±0.23% (93 runs sampled)\n> - DEKHash(key) x 1,913,679 ops/sec ±0.52% (92 runs sampled)\n> - BPHash(key) x 1,970,864 ops/sec ±0.43% (91 runs sampled)\n> - FNVHash(key) x 1,784,257 ops/sec ±0.51% (90 runs sampled)\n> - APHash(key) x 1,780,209 ops/sec ±0.39% (92 runs sampled)\n> - MurmurHash3_x86_32(key, 42) x 2,491,832 ops/sec ±0.42% (91 runs sampled)\n> - MurmurHash3_x86_128(key, 42) x 580,621 ops/sec ±0.51% (91 runs sampled)\n> - Fastest is MurmurHash3_x86_32(key, 42)\n\n## Functions\n> - RSHash(key);\n> - JSHash(key);\n> - PJWHash(key);\n> - ELFHash(key);\n> - BKDRHash(key);\n> - SDBMHash(key);\n> - DEKHash(key);\n> - BPHash(key);\n> - FNVHash(key);\n> - APHash(key);\n> - MurmurHash3_x86_32(key [,seed]);\n> - MurmurHash3_x86_128(key [,seed]);\n\n## People\n\n- [liushoukai](https://github.com/liushoukai) [![liushoukai's gratipay][gratipay-image-liushoukai]][gratipay-url-liushoukai]\n- [List of all contributors](https://github.com/liushoukai/node-hashes/graphs/contributors)\n\n## License\n\n[![GitHub license][license-image]][license-url]\n\n\n\n[node-image]: https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-%3E=_0.11-brightgreen.svg?style=flat\n[node-url]: http://nodejs.org/download\n\n[npm-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/node-hashes.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/node-hashes\n\n[downloads-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/node-hashes.svg\n[downloads-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/node-hashes\n\n[travis-image]: https://img.shields.io/travis/liushoukai/node-hashes/master.svg?label=linux\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/liushoukai/node-hashes\n\n[appveyor-image]: https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/liushoukai/node-hashes/master.svg?label=windows\n[appveyor-url]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/liushoukai/node-hashes\n\n[coveralls-image]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/liushoukai/node-hashes/master.svg\n[coveralls-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/liushoukai/node-hashes?branch=master\n\n[gratipay-image-liushoukai]: https://img.shields.io/gratipay/liushoukai.svg\n[gratipay-url-liushoukai]: https://gratipay.com/liushoukai/\n\n[license-image]: https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg\n[license-url]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liushoukai/node-hashes/master/LICENSE\n\n[codeclimate-image]:https://codeclimate.com/github/liushoukai/node-hashes/badges/gpa.svg\n[codeclimate-url]:https://codeclimate.com/github/liushoukai/node-hashes\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2015-10-16T06:26:20.201Z","modified":"2016-02-02T08:15:42.497Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"liushoukai","email":"21156929@qq.com"},"owners":[{"name":"liushoukai","email":"21156929@qq.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"node-hashes","_nodeVersion":"4.2.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-9-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/node-hashes-0.1.0.tgz_1454400941787_0.861573971575126"},"_npmUser":{"name":"liushoukai","email":"21156929@qq.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.7","_rev":"1-68d16bb31bc4364fa3a73ff2193359a8","_shasum":"657caa0c81f8b3666e580b265e568f1af7b314f3","author":{"name":"liushoukai"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/liushoukai/node-hashes/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"657caa0c81f8b3666e580b265e568f1af7b314f3","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/node-hashes/-/node-hashes-0.1.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"liushoukai","email":"21156929@qq.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-02-02T08:15:42.497Z","created":"2015-10-16T06:26:20.201Z","0.0.1":"2015-10-16T06:26:20.201Z","0.0.2":"2015-10-16T06:30:03.073Z","0.0.3":"2015-10-16T06:37:53.006Z","0.0.4":"2015-11-06T07:28:05.605Z","0.1.0":"2016-02-02T08:15:42.497Z"},"users":{"liushoukai":true}}}
