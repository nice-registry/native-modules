It's developed in C++ for Marlin and Repetier firmwares.\n\n## Features\n* Emission of events when connecting / disconnecting printers & more.\n* Control many printers at the same time.\n* Send gcode commands.\n* Print Gcode files.\n* Pause / Resume / Stop prints\n* Check printer status (temperatures, progress, coordinates, current layer, etc).\n* Read communication logs.\n\n# Installation\nThere are pre-built binaries of this project.\nInstallation can be done with `npm`:\n```\nnpm install --save formide-drivers\n```\n\n\n# Build\nTo build from source, follow these instructions:\n\n* Clone this repository.\n* run `npm install` to install dependencies.\n* Clean and build using `node-gyp rebuild` or `node-pre-gyp rebuild`.\n\nThe output is a binary called Formidriver.node located at `formide-drivers/build/Release`. You can import it and include it in your application.\n\n\n# Integration\nFormide-drivers is a NodeJS Addon, so integrating it in your project is very easy.\n- See a minimal example of implementation [here][1].\n- See a real implementation case [here][2] (formide-client-2).\n\n\n# Contributing\nYou can contribute to `formide-drivers` by closing issues (via fork -> pull request to development), adding features or just using it and report bugs!\nPlease check the issue list of this repo before adding new ones to see if we're already aware of the issue that you're having.\n\n\n# Credits\n- [Doodle3D](https://github.com/doodle3d): [print3d](https://github.com/doodle3d/print3d)\n\n\n# Licence\nPlease check LICENSE.md for licensing information.\n\n\n\n[1]:https://github.com/PRINTR3D/formide-drivers/blob/master/examples/FormidriverFunctions.js\n[2]:https://github.com/PRINTR3D/formide-client-2/tree/master/src/core/drivers\n","versions":[{"number":"1.0.0","date":"2015-11-02T15:18:56.134Z"},{"number":"3.0.4","date":"2015-11-02T15:27:31.063Z"},{"number":"3.0.5","date":"2015-11-02T18:37:29.308Z"},{"number":"4.1.0","date":"2015-12-08T14:59:30.710Z"},{"number":"4.1.1","date":"2015-12-08T15:06:49.391Z"},{"number":"6.6.6","date":"2017-04-28T14:45:10.657Z"},{"number":"6.6.7","date":"2017-05-01T08:37:26.432Z"},{"number":"6.6.8","date":"2017-05-17T09:37:55.061Z"}],"created":"2015-11-02T15:18:56.134Z","modified":"2017-05-17T09:37:55.061Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"printr3d","email":"chris@printr.nl"},"owners":[{"name":"printr3d","email":"chris@printr.nl"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"formide-drivers","_nodeVersion":"4.2.2","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/formide-drivers-6.6.8.tgz_1495013873040_0.623998480848968"},"_npmUser":{"name":"printr3d","email":"chris@printr.nl"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.7","_rev":"3-42f0efd3bf1ae124bd28d80532592767","_shasum":"d6dd35f0fc0902b15e2512fd3101d1c6359697b3","author":"","directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"6.6.8"},"dist":{"shasum":"d6dd35f0fc0902b15e2512fd3101d1c6359697b3","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/formide-drivers/-/formide-drivers-6.6.8.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"printr3d","email":"chris@printr.nl"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-05-17T09:37:55.061Z","created":"2015-11-02T15:18:56.134Z","1.0.0":"2015-11-02T15:18:56.134Z","3.0.4":"2015-11-02T15:27:31.063Z","3.0.5":"2015-11-02T18:37:29.308Z","4.1.0":"2015-12-08T14:59:30.710Z","4.1.1":"2015-12-08T15:06:49.391Z","6.6.6":"2017-04-28T14:45:10.657Z","6.6.7":"2017-05-01T08:37:26.432Z","6.6.8":"2017-05-17T09:37:55.061Z"}}}
