It's useful as a drop-in replacement for Node's old, private module `IOWatcher`.\n\nMore information on `uv_poll`:\n\n- [libuv header (look for `uv_poll_t`)](https://github.com/joyent/libuv/blob/master/include/uv.h)\n- [External I/O with polling (libuv docs)](http://nikhilm.github.io/uvbook/utilities.html#external-i-o-with-polling)\n- [fs: remove fs.watchFile(), IOWatcher (Node.js bug #3348)](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/3348)\n- [IOWatcher broken since 0.7.9 (Node.js bug #4136)](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/4136)\n\n##Installation and use\n\n```$ npm install socketwatcher```\n\n```javascript\nvar SocketWatcher = require(\"socketwatcher\").SocketWatcher;\nvar watcher = new SocketWatcher();\nwatcher.callback = function() { [...] };\nwatcher.set(fd, read_flag, write_flag);\nwatcher.start();\n// watcher.stop();\n```\n\nNote: since version 0.2.0, you must use `require(\"socketwatcher\").SocketWatcher`, instead of using the module object directly. Sorry for the inconvenience.\n\n##Original work\n\nThe files contributed to node_mdns:\n\n- [socket_watcher.hpp](https://github.com/agnat/node_mdns/blob/6dbd4619c2fe47a17cbc5d236a8e057eb08a1b41/src/socket_watcher.hpp)\n- [socket_watcher.cpp](https://github.com/agnat/node_mdns/blob/6dbd4619c2fe47a17cbc5d236a8e057eb08a1b41/src/socket_watcher.cpp)\n\n##License\n\nMIT licensed, see LICENSE.\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2013-05-10T16:14:01.307Z","modified":"2015-10-03T05:14:20.653Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"ide","email":"ide+npm@jameside.com"},"owners":[{"name":"btrask","email":"bentrask@comcast.net"},{"name":"ide","email":"ide+npm@jameside.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"socketwatcher","_nodeVersion":"4.1.0","_npmUser":{"name":"ide","email":"ide+npm@jameside.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.3","_rev":"1-25e0026c4f47a11364599d192fd91226","_shasum":"49e5614058fcaab19d640b374225a4eea4b4b78a","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/btrask/node-socketwatcher/issues","email":"bentrastk@comcast.net"},"contributors":[{"name":"Toby Ealden","email":"toby.ealden@gmail.com"},{"name":"Ben Trask","email":"bentrask@comcast.net"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.3.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"49e5614058fcaab19d640b374225a4eea4b4b78a","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/socketwatcher/-/socketwatcher-0.3.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"btrask","email":"bentrask@comcast.net"},{"name":"ide","email":"ide+npm@jameside.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-10-03T05:14:20.653Z","created":"2013-05-10T16:14:01.307Z","0.1.0":"2013-05-10T16:14:18.230Z","0.1.1":"2013-05-10T16:31:46.983Z","0.1.2":"2013-05-10T16:37:33.217Z","0.2.0":"2013-06-16T12:57:01.940Z","0.3.0":"2015-10-03T05:14:20.653Z"},"users":{"skepticfx":true}}}
