MIDI messages are sent by\nwriting an array to the stream.\n\n### Simple example\n\nPlaying middle C:\n\n```javascript\nvar coremidi = require('coremidi')();\n\ncoremidi.write([144, 60, 127]);\nsetTimeout(function() {\n  coremidi.write([128, 60, 0]);\n}, 2000);\n```\n\n### Example with [midi-api](https://github.com/carlos8f/node-midi-api)\n\n```javascript\nvar coremidi = require('coremidi')\n  , midi = require('midi-api')()\n\nmidi\n  .bank(2)\n  .program(4)\n  .rest(500)\n\nfunction maj7 (root) {\n  midi\n    .noteOn(root)\n    .noteOn(root + 4)\n    .noteOn(root + 7)\n    .noteOn(root + 11)\n    .rest(1000)\n    .noteOff()\n}\n\nmaj7(60)\nmaj7(61)\nmaj7(62)\nmaj7(63)\n\nmidi.pipe(coremidi());\n```\n\n- - -\n\n### Developed by [Terra Eclipse](http://www.terraeclipse.com)\nTerra Eclipse, Inc. is a nationally recognized political technology and\nstrategy firm located in Aptos, CA and Washington, D.C.\n\n- - -\n\n### Thanks\n\nThanks to [UrGuardian4ngel](https://github.com/UrGuardian4ngel) for providing NAN (node > 0.11) support!\n\n---\n\n### License: MIT\n\n- Copyright (C) 2012 Carlos Rodriguez (http://s8f.org/)\n- Copyright (C) 2012 Terra Eclipse, Inc.
