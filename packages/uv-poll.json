It's an event emitter wrapper for [libuv's UV_POLL_T struct](http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/poll.html).\n\nThe underlying event stream is continuous so instead of emitting all of them we ask for the next one. This can be done two ways.\n\n- `poll.once(event, callback)` this automatically calls `poll()` for the correct event\n- `poll.poll(eventInt)` asks `uv_poll_start` to poll for these additional events\n\n```js\nconst fd = fs.openSync('file')\nconst poll = new Poller(fd)\npoll.once('readable', () => console.log(`fd ${fd} is now readable`))\npoll.once('writable', () => console.log(`fd ${fd} is now writable`))\npoll.once('disconnect', () => console.log(`fd ${fd} is now disconnect`)) // means not readable or writable\n```\n\nThis is tested pretty heavily in serialport. Happy to land any any improvements, tests, or fixes.\n","created":"2017-07-09T03:21:18.132Z","modified":"2017-07-09T16:27:05.101Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"reconbot","email":"wizard@roborooter.com"},"owners":[{"name":"reconbot","email":"wizard@roborooter.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"uv-poll","_nodeVersion":"6.10.3","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/uv-poll-1.0.0.tgz_1499617624159_0.8763240894768387"},"_npmUser":{"name":"reconbot","email":"wizard@roborooter.com"},"_npmVersion":"5.0.4","_rev":"2-648ac890a48117c97107f1c0ce8122db","author":"","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/reconbot/uv-poll/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-s9njy1VAlvUdmDzD3ftSvdNRzMDcgV8tQq50hfT3MFLU0waDyXFOsrxs/0xMZAAXWyRBRjFdu4ww0YTH/lkztA==","shasum":"4097a0bfad909f45cb0ec30d3580fd740698b81f","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/uv-poll/-/uv-poll-1.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"reconbot","email":"wizard@roborooter.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-07-09T16:27:05.101Z","created":"2017-07-09T03:21:18.132Z","0.0.1":"2017-07-09T03:21:18.132Z","1.0.0":"2017-07-09T16:27:05.101Z"}}}
