So we recommend at least v0.7.5.\n\n- GLEW (http://glew.sourceforge.net/)\nGLEW is used to find OpenGL extensions in a cross-platform manner.\n\n- GLFW (http://www.glfw.org/)\nGLFW is a simple multi-platform framework for opening a window, creating an OpenGL context, and managing input.\n\n- AntTweakBar (http://www.antisphere.com/Wiki/tools:anttweakbar)\nAntTweakBar allows programmers to quickly add a light and intuitive graphical user interface into graphic applications to interactively tweak parameters on-screen. \n\nAll of these libraries are cross-platform. node-glfw provides a Javascript wrapper to access native methods in GLFW and AntTweakBar. See example of usage in node-webgl/test/cube.js.\n\nOnce dependent libraries are installed, do\n```\nnpm install node-gyp\nnpm install --save bindings nan\nnode-gyp rebuild\n```\n\nInstallation (Mac)\n-------------------------\nUse Homebrew\n```\nbrew install pkg-config glfw3 anttweakbar glew\n```\n\nInstallation (Linux)\n-------------------------\nUse apt-get or similar package manager\n```\nsudo apt-get install libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libfreeimage-dev libglew-dev libxi-dev\n```\n\nDownload AntTweakBar\n```\ncd AntTweakBar/src\nmake\nsudo cp ../include/* /usr/local/include\nsudo cp ../liblibAntTweakBar.* /usr/local/lib\n```\n\nDownload GLFW3 (do not use ```apt-get install libglfw-dev```, it is wrong version)\n```\ncd glfw\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ..\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\nInstallation (Windows)\n----------------------\n\nHave Visual Studio (Express version works fine) installed.\nWindows dependencies are bundled with this package, so `npm install node-glfw` should work out-of-box. The binary packages for Windows on their respective web site above do work as well but you'll need to change the path in ```bindings.gyp``` to point to where you installed them, includes and libs.\n\nNotes\n-----\n- node-glfw is a just a platform binding so don't expect samples here. You should install node-webgl, which contains lots of tests and examples using node-glfw features including AntTweakBar. See node-webgl/test/cube.js for an example of using AntTweakBar with your webgl code.\n- run ```node test/test.js``` to see a colored triangle with mouse tracking in the command-line. This indicates all is installed correctly.\n\n\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2012-04-19T00:40:22.120Z","modified":"2015-12-07T22:47:26.366Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"mikeseven","email":"mikeseven@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"mikeseven","email":"mikeseven@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"node-glfw","_nodeVersion":"5.1.1","_npmUser":{"name":"mikeseven","email":"mikeseven@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.3.12","_rev":"1-05b5524e0d69e22f7b0d75915fc260ff","_shasum":"cb75fc8ab2925223a8192dd61504886439bcf158","author":{"name":"Mikael Bourges-Sevenier","email":"mikeseven@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mikeseven/node-glfw/issues"},"directories":{"src":"src","lib":"lib","test":"test"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.4.6"},"dist":{"shasum":"cb75fc8ab2925223a8192dd61504886439bcf158","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/node-glfw/-/node-glfw-0.4.6.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"mikeseven","email":"mikeseven@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-12-07T22:47:26.366Z","created":"2012-04-19T00:40:22.120Z","0.1.0":"2012-04-19T00:40:25.586Z","0.1.1":"2012-04-19T22:06:22.147Z","0.1.2":"2012-06-30T04:56:54.217Z","0.1.3":"2013-10-31T18:03:40.156Z","0.2.0":"2014-03-29T18:51:39.059Z","0.2.1":"2014-03-31T16:49:12.534Z","0.3.0":"2014-07-02T01:23:30.313Z","0.3.1":"2014-07-02T17:04:06.701Z","0.4.0":"2015-11-20T08:21:16.894Z","0.4.1":"2015-11-26T04:01:07.422Z","0.4.2":"2015-11-26T06:28:39.042Z","0.4.3":"2015-11-26T06:40:16.434Z","0.4.4":"2015-11-27T22:20:16.358Z","0.4.5":"2015-12-07T22:25:26.934Z","0.4.6":"2015-12-07T22:47:26.366Z"},"users":{"pandao":true}}}
