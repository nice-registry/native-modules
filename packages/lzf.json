Compression speed can be increased by 20% by sacrificing a few percent of compression ratio.\n* Mediocre compression ratios - you can usually expect about 40-50% compression for typical binary data\n* Easy to use (just two functions, no state attached)\n* Highly portable (written in C)\n* Tunable, see the file lzfP.h in the distribution, to tailor liblzf to your needs. The generated compressed blocks can be decompressed by any liblzf version regardless of the options used to compress.\n* Freely usable (BSD-type-license)\n\n### Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar lzf = require(\"lzf\");\n\n\nvar lorem = \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\" +\n    \"Curabitur volutpat, nulla nec egestas semper,\" +\n    \"ante dui tristique nibh, quis feugiat.\";\n\n// create buffer of your data\nvar loremBuffer = new Buffer(lorem);\n\n// compress your buffer and get another buffer\nvar loremCompressed = lzf.compress(loremBuffer);\n\n// decompress compressed buffer\nvar loremDecompressed = lzf.decompress(loremCompressed);\n\n```\n\n### Benchmarks\n\nBenchmarks against [compress-buffer](https://github.com/egorFiNE/node-compress-buffer) library.
