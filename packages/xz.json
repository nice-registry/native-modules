Read more about LZMA here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel-Ziv-Markov_chain_algorithm\n\n\nInstall\n-------\n\n```sh\n$ npm install\n$ npm run test\n```\n\n\nAPI\n---\n\nThe API consists of only two stream transform classes: `Compressor` and `Decompressor`.\n\n- `new xz.Compressor([preset], [options])`\n- `new xz.Decompressor([options])`\n\nThe options object is passed to node's `Transform`. Compression takes a \"preset\" number, which is an abstraction of the compression difficulty level, from 1 to 9, where 1 puts in the least effort. The default is 6.\n\nBoth objects are stream transforms that consume and produce Buffers. Here's example code to compress the sample file included with this distribution:\n\n```javascript\nvar fs = require(\"fs\");\nvar xz = require(\"xz\");\n\nvar compression = new xz.Compressor(9);\nvar inFile = fs.createReadStream(\"./testdata/minecraft.png\");\nvar outFile = fs.createWriteStream(\"./testdata/minecraft.png.lzma2\");\n\ninFile.pipe(compression).pipe(outFile);\n```\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nApache 2 (open-source) license, included in 'LICENSE.txt'.\n\n\nAuthors\n-------\n\n- @robey - Robey Pointer <robeypointer@gmail.com>\n","created":"2014-07-29T17:31:00.524Z","modified":"2016-05-07T02:34:09.839Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"robey","email":"robeypointer@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"robey","email":"robeypointer@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"xz","_nodeVersion":"4.2.4","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/xz-1.2.2.tgz_1462588446234_0.4657544819638133"},"_npmUser":{"name":"robey","email":"robeypointer@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.12","_rev":"1-ea826e9acce105a33157a0cb6e37d07a","_shasum":"0e9920a705b45055b45925dc0ee357b1e8deabe9","author":{"name":"Robey Pointer","email":"robeypointer@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/robey/node-xz/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.2.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"0e9920a705b45055b45925dc0ee357b1e8deabe9","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/xz/-/xz-1.2.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"robey","email":"robeypointer@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-05-07T02:34:09.839Z","created":"2014-07-29T17:31:00.524Z","1.0.0":"2014-07-29T17:31:00.524Z","1.0.1":"2014-07-29T17:33:59.999Z","1.0.2":"2014-09-04T15:46:16.365Z","1.0.3":"2014-09-04T15:48:18.913Z","1.0.4":"2014-12-08T05:37:26.015Z","1.1.1":"2015-02-08T19:51:27.925Z","1.2.0":"2015-08-21T03:12:35.566Z","1.2.1":"2015-12-26T17:38:50.211Z","1.2.2":"2016-05-07T02:34:09.839Z"}}}
