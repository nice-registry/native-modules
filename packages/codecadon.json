This software has been developed against the long term stable (LTS) release.\r\n\r\nCodecadon is designed to be `require`d to use from your own application to provide async processing.\r\n\r\n    npm install --save codecadon\r\n\r\nNode.js addons use [libuv](http://libuv.org/) which by default supports up to 4 async threads in a threadpool for activities such as file I/O. These same threads are used by codecadon and if you wish to use a number of the functions in one Node.js process then you will need to set the environment variable UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE to a suitable number before the first use of the libuv threadpool.\r\n\r\n## Using codecadon\r\n\r\nTo use codecadon in your own application, `require` the module then create and use workers as required.  The processing functions follow a standard pattern as shown in the example code below.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar codecadon = require('codecadon');\r\nvar fn = new codecadon.fn(params);\r\n\r\nfn.on('exit', function() {\r\n  fn.finish();\r\n});\r\nfn.on('error', function(err) {\r\n// handle error\r\n});\r\n\r\n// start the processing thread\r\nfn.start();\r\n\r\n// async request for processing to be done\r\nfn.doFn(params, function(err, result) {\r\n});\r\n\r\n// async request for the processing thread to quit\r\nfn.quit(function() {\r\n});\r\n```\r\n## Status, support and further development\r\n\r\nThere is currently a limited set of video packing formats and codecs supported.  There has been no attempt made to tune encoder parameters for performance or quality.\r\n\r\nAlthough the architecture of codecadon is such that it could be used at scale in production environments, development is not yet complete. In its current state, it is recommended that this software is used in development environments and for building prototypes. Future development will make this more appropriate for production use.\r\n\r\nContributions can be made via pull requests and will be considered by the author on their merits. Enhancement requests and bug reports should be raised as github issues.
