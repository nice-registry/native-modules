The BeagleBone has 2 PRUs which are separate to the main CPU and run at 200MHz with access to 16 GPIOs each. The benefits of executing code on the PRU are guaranteed realtime execution (outside of the OS) with no load on the primary CPU. The PRUs are coded in [TIs own assembly instruction set](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/PRU_Assembly_Instructions) and can communicate with code running within the OS via interrupts and shared memory space. \r\n\r\nThis README does not aim to be a complete guide to setting up the PRUs and using them from Node.js. As it is mostly built on the [AM335x_PRU Drivers](https://github.com/beagleboard/am335x_pru_package), the [Python PRU bindings](https://bitbucket.org/intelligentagent/pypruss) and the [BBB PRU setup guide](http://www.element14.com/community/community/knode/single-board_computers/next-gen_beaglebone/blog/2013/05/22/bbb--working-with-the-pru-icssprussv2), you can refer to these sources for more information about the PRUs.\r\n\r\n##Fork\r\n\r\nThis is a fork of [https://github.com/omcaree/node-pru](https://github.com/omcaree/node-pru) which adds a `loadDataFile` method and modifies `execute` to accept a entry point address parameter for loading and execution of PRU binaries produced by TI's C compiler.\r\n\r\nThe Name of the Game\r\n------------------\r\nThis package is essentially a Node.js bindings for the [AM335x_PRU Drivers](https://github.com/beagleboard/am335x_pru_package).\r\n\r\nTo use this code you need to load *uio_pruss* and (possibly) configure an appropriate *device tree* fragment. Here I assume you know how to\r\ndo this.\r\n\r\nWorking with device tree, loading kernel modules, installing *PASM* tool are outside the scope of this document. This code does (some of the) functions\r\nof the [AM335x_PRU Drivers](https://github.com/beagleboard/am335x_pru_package), that, essentially allow reading/writing the PRU memory, loading and executing PRU firmware, and working with PRU interrupts. \r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nTo install the module simply type\r\n\r\n\tnpm install node-pru-extended \r\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2015-06-29T01:00:04.614Z","modified":"2015-12-24T19:23:21.657Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"mattcarpenter","email":"mattcarpenter@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"mattcarpenter","email":"mattcarpenter@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"node-pru-extended","_nodeVersion":"4.2.4","_npmUser":{"name":"mattcarpenter","email":"mattcarpenter@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.12","_rev":"1-b68c0ddd97765cd395162901b6dd356d","_shasum":"4447387027eb5731ac0e253c553eb4ce01dfffc8","author":{"name":"Mike Kroutikov"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mattcarpenter/node-pru-extended/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"4447387027eb5731ac0e253c553eb4ce01dfffc8","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/node-pru-extended/-/node-pru-extended-1.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"mattcarpenter","email":"mattcarpenter@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-12-24T19:23:21.657Z","created":"2015-06-29T01:00:04.614Z","0.0.2":"2015-06-29T01:00:04.614Z","0.0.3":"2015-06-29T01:02:22.387Z","0.0.4":"2015-06-29T01:06:07.683Z","0.0.5":"2015-06-29T01:17:37.695Z","0.0.6":"2015-06-29T01:27:03.299Z","0.0.7":"2015-06-29T02:00:47.543Z","0.0.8":"2015-06-29T02:11:46.756Z","0.0.9":"2015-06-29T03:50:25.879Z","0.0.10":"2015-07-12T18:30:49.085Z","0.0.11":"2015-07-12T18:39:18.697Z","0.0.12":"2015-12-24T02:10:56.673Z","1.0.0":"2015-12-24T19:23:21.657Z"},"users":{"kizzlebot":true}}}
