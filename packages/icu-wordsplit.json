After it finishes you should have all the required ICU\nheaders and binaries in your default build path ready to be used.\n\nAfterwards, switch to your project folder and\n\n    npm install icu-wordsplit\n\nAnd you should now be able to `require('icu-wordsplit')` in your code.\n\n## API\n\nRight now the only function call available is exported from the module.\n\n#### splitWords ( [locale], string )\n\nSplits the specified string into words using ICU-defined word boundary.\n\n    var splitWords = require('icu-wordsplit');\n\n    var results = splitWords('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.');\n    console.log(results);\n\n    results = splitWords('th_TH', 'แยกคำภาษาไทยก็ทำได้นะจ้ะ');\n    console.log(results);\n\nThe first argument is the locale. You *must* specify an ICU-compatible locale name here.\nHowever, this argument is now optional as you can use `en_US` to split most\nstrings without problem.\n\nThe second argument is the string to which to split.\n\nThe function will returns an array of words. Whitespaces and some common punctuations\nmay be automatically removed from the list.\n\n## LICENSE\n\nBSD\n\n## TODO / CONTRIBUTE\n\nAll contributions welcome!\n\nCompile and run tests with\n\n```sh\nmake test\n```\n\nHere's something to do:\n\n* More tests with more languages.\n* Add more ICU functionality (like locale auto-detection.)\n* Fix gyp and C++ build problems once and for all.\n\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2012-06-10T09:47:22.552Z","modified":"2015-12-25T09:25:10.094Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"chakrit","email":"service@chakrit.net"},"owners":[{"name":"chakrit","email":"service@chakrit.net"},{"name":"vladwing","email":"vlad.wing@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"icu-wordsplit","_nodeVersion":"5.3.0","_npmUser":{"name":"chakrit","email":"service@chakrit.net"},"_npmVersion":"3.3.12","_rev":"1-3d25a7b769f0aa6ff8bd171c597bb5cc","_shasum":"52ecae48ba89d434abf9072276714d0f2aad852a","author":{"name":"Chakrit Wichian","email":"service@chakrit.net","url":"http://chakrit.net"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/chakrit/node-icu-wordsplit/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.3.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"52ecae48ba89d434abf9072276714d0f2aad852a","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/icu-wordsplit/-/icu-wordsplit-0.3.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"chakrit","email":"service@chakrit.net"},{"name":"vladwing","email":"vlad.wing@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-12-25T09:25:10.094Z","created":"2012-06-10T09:47:22.552Z","0.1.0":"2012-06-10T09:47:27.902Z","0.1.1":"2012-06-10T10:28:57.841Z","0.1.2":"2012-08-01T17:58:43.720Z","0.1.3":"2012-08-01T18:01:17.855Z","0.2.0":"2012-09-23T16:46:34.864Z","0.2.1":"2012-09-26T11:52:00.630Z","0.2.2":"2012-09-27T19:57:44.232Z","0.2.3":"2012-12-09T15:02:52.023Z","0.3.0":"2015-12-25T08:34:19.872Z"},"users":{"fgribreau":true}}}
