Pull requests are welcome.\n\n## Installing\n\nThis requires `libpodofo` to be installed. If you are using Ubuntu, the\nfollowing command should suffice:\n\n    sudo apt-get install libpodofo-dev\n\nThen, installing this library is as simple as:\n\n    npm install podofo\n\n# Using with node \n\n\n```javascript\nconst podofo = require('podofo');\n\nlet pdf = new podofo.PdfMemDocument(false);\npdf.Load('/path/to/a/file.pdf');\n\nconsole.log(pdf.GetInfo().GetAuthor());\n// Will return software author\n```\n\n\n# Building on Windows\n\nPoDoFo (minimally) depends on zlib and freetype. You will also need the source\nfor PoDoFo itself. You can download these packages and extract them into `deps/`.\n\nAfter extraction, the directory tree should look like this:\n\n> - deps/\n>   - freetype/\n>   - podofo/\n>   - zlib/\n\nThe following versions have been tested:\n\n- freetype: 2.8\n- podofo: 0.9.5\n- zlib: 1.2.11\n\nThen you just need to run `node-pre-gyp configure build` to obtain a binary.\n\nOf course, you will also need to have a toolchain installed. This has been tested\nwith Visual Studio 2015. The Community edition is available from Microsoft for\nfree.\n\n# Examples\n\nYou can exec a simple GetAuthor() & text-extractor:\n\nFrom your main module(main-module/node_modules/node-podofo) just launch:\n\n    node node_modules/node-podofo/index.js\n\n# Dev\n\nTo complie from source node-podofo just :\n\n    git submodule init\n    git submodule update\n    npm install --build-from-source\n\nThis will recreate the bin in ./lib\n\n\n# Debug & Logs\n\nBy default log & debug are disable, to enable them when you can just pass `true` option to PdfMemDocument as:\n\n`var pdf = new podofo.PdfMemDocument(true);`\n\n# Notice\n\nAll Podofo Classes cannot be used directly, for example, PdfError could be called only via c++, not javascript binding.\nIf you want to update this fork, you must know about c++/Node.js, podofo, node-addons, Nan V8, node-pre-gyp, node-pre-gyp-github & use travis for build for OSX+Linux and Appveyor to build for Windows.\n\n","versions":[{"number":"0.9.5","date":"2017-08-11T12:57:18.261Z"},{"number":"1.0.0","date":"2017-08-11T16:59:09.368Z"},{"number":"1.2.0","date":"2017-08-17T09:10:41.757Z"}],"created":"2017-08-11T12:57:18.261Z","modified":"2017-08-17T09:10:41.757Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"rmeja","email":"remy.meja@inist.fr"},"owners":[{"name":"iryu54","email":"corentinlabroche@gmail.com"},{"name":"matthd","email":"matthias.dieudonne@gmail.com"},{"name":"rmeja","email":"remy.meja@inist.fr"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"node-podofo","_nodeVersion":"8.4.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/node-podofo-1.2.0.tgz_1502961040490_0.2659827347379178"},"_npmUser":{"name":"rmeja","email":"remy.meja@inist.fr"},"_npmVersion":"5.3.0","_rev":"6-0dc2fea21dd4ac199a6a522cab4a78d5","author":{"name":"Wong Yong Jie","email":"yjwong92@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/matthd/node-podofoissues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.2.0"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-Or0pagP4NycOv/zaZqcTrgQKC8haK58YyjApI/SSeOonN25Ge5p6jEmgjgoA/bySx1pUV+IcB7ASRRQh12cvcw==","shasum":"4bcdf4f05f3ac8034586991a0163d20a149e125e","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/node-podofo/-/node-podofo-1.2.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"iryu54","email":"corentinlabroche@gmail.com"},{"name":"matthd","email":"matthias.dieudonne@gmail.com"},{"name":"rmeja","email":"remy.meja@inist.fr"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-08-17T09:10:41.757Z","created":"2017-08-11T12:57:18.261Z","0.9.5":"2017-08-11T12:57:18.261Z","1.0.0":"2017-08-11T16:59:09.368Z","1.2.0":"2017-08-17T09:10:41.757Z"}}}
