The formats include:\n\n *  PNG\n *  PDF\n *  SVG\n *  Raw memory buffer image\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/2gis/node-rsvg.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/2gis/node-rsvg)\n\nThis repository is fork of https://github.com/walling/node-rsvg and has windows support and don't need to export some variables for successfully building on OSX.\nAlso this fork fixes problem with zero-sized buffer rendered in some real rare cases.\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nHere is a simple example. Look in `index.js` for more documentation.\n\n```javascript\nvar Rsvg = require('librsvg').Rsvg;\nvar fs = require('fs');\n\n// Create SVG render instance.\nvar svg = new Rsvg();\n\n// When finishing reading SVG, render and save as PNG image.\nsvg.on('finish', function() {\n  console.log('SVG width: ' + svg.width);\n  console.log('SVG height: ' + svg.height);\n  fs.writeFile('tiger.png', svg.render({\n    format: 'png',\n    width: 600,\n    height: 400\n  }).data);\n});\n\n// Stream SVG file into render instance.\nfs.createReadStream('tiger.svg').pipe(svg);\n```\n\n## Possible breaking changes\n\nBefore v0.6.0 in case of error `getBaseURI` returned `null`.\nSince v0.6.0 possibly breaking change was introduced: now `getBaseURI` method always returns string. In case of error an empty string is returned, so it might affect user code that relies on strict equality to `null`. \n\n## Installation\n\nFirst install the LibRSVG library and header files. Usually you have to look for a *development* package version. You must also have a functioning build tool chain including `pkg-config`. You can find instructions for different operating systems below. After that, you simply run:\n\n```bash\nnpm install librsvg\n```\n\nLibrary versions known to work:\n\n *  LibRSVG 2.26+\n *  Cairo 1.8.8+\n\n#### Ubuntu:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install librsvg2-dev\n```\n\n#### RedHat / OpenSUSE:\n\n```bash\nsudo yum install librsvg2-devel\n```\n\n#### Mac OS X:\n\n```bash\nbrew install librsvg\n```\n\nIf, after installing LibRSVG through homebrew you are experiencing issues installing this module, try manually exporting the package config with this command:\n\n```bash\nexport PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig\n```\n\nThen try reinstalling this module. For further information, [see this thread](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/14123).\n\n#### Windows:\n\nYou will need cairo and librsvg-2 libraries which is bundled in GTK.\nGo to http://www.gtk.org/download/win64.php (or http://www.gtk.org/download/win32.php for 32-bit node)\nand download the all-in-one bundle (these instructions used the following zip http://win32builder.gnome.org/gtk+-bundle_3.6.4-20131201_win64.zip).\nUnzip the contents in C:\\GTK (if you want to change this you must define -GTK_Root=c:\\another\\path shell variable to npm or node-gyp to reflect your changes),\nand add \"C:\\GTK\\bin;\" to the PATH environment variable in Windows, it's necessary for node-rsvg runtime to load those libs.\n","versions":[{"number":"0.3.1","date":"2014-06-25T08:23:33.816Z"},{"number":"0.5.0","date":"2014-12-15T06:52:09.216Z"},{"number":"0.5.2","date":"2015-06-23T10:21:33.600Z"},{"number":"0.6.0","date":"2015-09-25T11:09:10.348Z"},{"number":"0.6.1","date":"2015-09-25T12:37:41.658Z"},{"number":"0.6.2","date":"2016-04-08T08:20:29.755Z"},{"number":"0.6.3","date":"2016-04-21T11:10:33.786Z"},{"number":"0.6.4","date":"2016-07-11T08:40:39.435Z"},{"number":"0.7.0","date":"2016-07-12T09:04:24.665Z"}],"starsCount":1,"created":"2014-06-25T08:23:30.938Z","modified":"2016-07-12T09:04:24.665Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"heilage","email":"heilage.nsk@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"2gis","email":"a.biryukov@2gis.ru"},{"name":"anru","email":"version.ru@gmail.com"},{"name":"heilage","email":"heilage.nsk@gmail.com"},{"name":"illbullet","email":"alex.biryukoff@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"librsvg","_nodeVersion":"6.3.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/librsvg-0.7.0.tgz_1468314262936_0.31076699984259903"},"_npmUser":{"name":"heilage","email":"heilage.nsk@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.3","_rev":"1-7242833f273ea7c64fd94f71cb487273","_shasum":"6d4885a7ad67335e8f112f71171bf77838f5de34","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/2gis/node-rsvg/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.7.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"6d4885a7ad67335e8f112f71171bf77838f5de34","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/librsvg/-/librsvg-0.7.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"2gis","email":"a.biryukov@2gis.ru"},{"name":"anru","email":"version.ru@gmail.com"},{"name":"heilage","email":"heilage.nsk@gmail.com"},{"name":"illbullet","email":"alex.biryukoff@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"readme.md","time":{"modified":"2016-07-12T09:04:24.665Z","created":"2014-06-25T08:23:30.938Z","0.3.1":"2014-06-25T08:23:33.816Z","0.5.0":"2014-12-15T06:52:09.216Z","0.5.2":"2015-06-23T10:21:33.600Z","0.6.0":"2015-09-25T11:09:10.348Z","0.6.1":"2015-09-25T12:37:41.658Z","0.6.2":"2016-04-08T08:20:29.755Z","0.6.3":"2016-04-21T11:10:33.786Z","0.6.4":"2016-07-11T08:40:39.435Z","0.7.0":"2016-07-12T09:04:24.665Z"},"users":{"fedor":true}}}
