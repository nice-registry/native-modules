Returns encrypted value as a base64 string. |\n| decrypt(string encrypted):int | Decrypts. Returns 1 or 0. |\n| export():object | Returns public key for use with Operator. |\n\n\n##### Operator\n```\nvar hcrypt = require('node-hcrypt');\n\nvar crypto = new hcrypt.Crypto();\n\nvar operator = new hcrypt.Operator(crypto.export());\n```\n\n###### Methods\n\n| Method | Description |\n| ---- | ----- |\n| add(string encryptedA, string encryptedB):string encryptedC | Performs logical addition. |\n| mul(string encryptedA, string encryptedB):string encryptedC | Performs logical multiplication. |\n| halfAdd(string encryptedA, string encryptedB):\\[string encryptedC, string carryD] | Performs half-addition with carry in return. |\n| fullAdd(string carryI, string encryptedA, string encryptedB):\\[string encryptedC, string carryD] | Performs full addition with a carry in return. |\n| recrypt(string encryptedI):string encryptedO | Performs cryptographic refresh. Should be done after 2-3 operations under the same encrypted value. |\n\n\n#### Tests\n\n*WIP*\n\n#### License\n\nMIT\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2015-12-22T11:27:18.374Z","modified":"2016-12-01T05:03:46.744Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"mindfreakthemon","email":"mfthemon@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"mindfreakthemon","email":"mfthemon@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"node-hcrypt","_nodeVersion":"6.3.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/node-hcrypt-0.0.8.tgz_1479061388101_0.43043773155659437"},"_npmUser":{"name":"mindfreakthemon","email":"mfthemon@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.7","_rev":"6-33df15905ed998ce8756a509c16a7d63","_shasum":"c7af31e4b42dbc5cae1fc961efbddb526c7d4994","author":{"name":"Vitalii Rakovtsii","url":"mfthemon@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mindfreakthemon/node-hcrypt/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.8"},"dist":{"shasum":"c7af31e4b42dbc5cae1fc961efbddb526c7d4994","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/node-hcrypt/-/node-hcrypt-0.0.8.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"mindfreakthemon","email":"mfthemon@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-12-01T05:03:46.744Z","created":"2015-12-22T11:27:18.374Z","0.0.1":"2015-12-22T11:27:18.374Z","0.0.2":"2015-12-22T19:29:03.541Z","0.0.3":"2015-12-23T06:56:58.857Z","0.0.4":"2016-11-13T06:28:40.230Z","0.0.6":"2016-11-13T06:45:32.812Z","0.0.7":"2016-11-13T16:57:17.396Z","0.0.8":"2016-11-13T18:23:10.558Z"},"users":{"shanewholloway":true}}}
