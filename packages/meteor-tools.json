Please refer to the official\n  installation [instructions](https://www.meteor.com/install) in the\n  meantime.**\n\n# Meteor\n\nhttps://circleci.com/gh/meteor/meteor/tree/devel.svg?style=shield&circle-token=c2d3c041506bd493ef3795ffa4448684cfce97b8\n\n\n\nMeteor is an ultra-simple environment for building modern web\napplications.\n\nWith Meteor you write apps:\n\n* in pure JavaScript\n* that send data over the wire, rather than HTML\n* using your choice of popular open-source libraries\n\nTry the getting started [tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/try).\n\nNext, read the [guide](http://guide.meteor.com) or the reference documentation at http://docs.meteor.com/.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nInstall Meteor:\n\n```bash\ncurl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh\n```\n\nCreate a project:\n\n```bash\nmeteor create try-meteor\n```\n\nRun it:\n\n```bash\ncd try-meteor\nmeteor\n```\n\n## Slow Start (for developers)\n\nIf you want to run on the bleeding edge, or help develop Meteor, you\ncan run Meteor directly from a git checkout.\n\n```bash\ngit clone git://github.com/meteor/meteor.git\ncd meteor\n```\n\nIf you're the sort of person who likes to build everything from scratch,\nyou can build all the Meteor dependencies (node.js, npm, mongodb, etc)\nwith the provided script. This requires git, a C and C++ compiler,\nautotools, and scons. If you do not run this script, Meteor will\nautomatically download pre-compiled binaries when you first run it.\n\n```bash\n# OPTIONAL\n./scripts/generate-dev-bundle.sh\n```\n\nNow you can run meteor directly from the checkout (if you did not\nbuild the dependency bundle above, this will take a few moments to\ndownload a pre-build version).\n\n```bash\n./meteor --help\n```\n\nFrom your checkout, you can read the docs locally. The `/docs` directory is a\nmeteor application, so simply change into the `/docs` directory and launch\nthe app:\n\n```bash\ncd docs/\n../meteor\n```\n\nYou'll then be able to read the docs locally in your browser at\n`http://localhost:3000/`.\n\nNote that if you run Meteor from a git checkout, you cannot pin apps to specific\nMeteor releases or run using different Meteor releases using `--release`.\n\n## Uninstalling Meteor\n\nAside from a short launcher shell script, Meteor installs itself inside your\nhome directory. To uninstall Meteor, run:\n\n```bash\nrm -rf ~/.meteor/\nsudo rm /usr/local/bin/meteor\n```\n\n## Developer Resources\n\nBuilding an application with Meteor?\n\n* Announcement list: sign up at http://www.meteor.com/\n* Having problems?
