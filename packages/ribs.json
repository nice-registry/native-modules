AFAIK this is probably because it asks a certain amount of time\nto choose and implement a solution. It often involves too much tools and management in the process.\nThe fact is, developers don't take enough time for this and tend to neglect this part of a modern Web application.\n\nI believe in the *on-the-fly* way of thinking that the Web can offer. So, you just ask the image you want,\nand you receive it already processed, end of story.\nThis also guaranties that you:\n\n- do not **load more than your are going to show**.\n- do not **scale the image in CSS**.\n- do not **load important images with javascript**.\n- do not **handle each image sizes manually**.\n- **do simply your workflow**.\n\n*From [RESS slides]*.\n\nSome great commercial services already exist to tackle this problem. But none of them is open source.\nThis needs to be available in the wild, with a good level of customization, so that Web developers\ncan leverage their images responsiveness.\n\n[client-side patterns]: http://css-tricks.com/which-responsive-images-solution-should-you-use\n[build tasks]: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-imagemin\n[RESS slides]: http://fr.slideshare.net/4nd3rsen/ress-responsive-design-server-side-components-10084972\n\n## Goals\n\n*RIBS* will:\n\n- Provide **on-the-fly** processed images (no build phase required).\n- Be **blazing fast**!\n- Be **super easy** to use and deploy.\n- **Proxy** existing servers so you can offload image processing.\n- **Optimize and transcode** images.\n- Support **SPDY**.\n- Fit **web apps** but also **native apps** needs.\n- Offer plugins to various existing platforms such as **WordPress** or **Joomla**.\n- Allow **to extensively customize it** so you can achieve precisely what you want.\n- Support [art direction], automatically perhaps?.\n\n[art direction]: http://usecases.responsiveimages.org/#art-direction\n\n## Roadmap\n\n - `✓` Basic *Node* module.<br>\n - `✓` Command line interface.<br>\n - `✕` Plugins for **Grunt**, **Gulp**, ...<br>\n - `✕` *Express* middleware with an effecient caching system.<br>\n - `✕` Client-side library.<br>\n - `✕` New awesome features...\n\n## Architecture\n\n*RIBS* will offer several independent layers, that work well together:\n\n- A native **Node** module that processes images:\n  - **Fast** using [OpenCV] as backend.\n  - **Extensible** via *custom operations*, *hooks* and *events*.\n  - **Smart** ensuring always valid images are produced.\n- An **Express** middleware that:\n  - Expose a **REST API**.\n  - **Proxy** existing servers.\n  - **Cache** processed images smartly.\n  - Support **clustering**.\n- A **client-side** library to:\n  - **Detect** device capabilities.\n  - **Automatically** build URLs.\n\n[OpenCV]: http://opencv.org\n\n## Documentation\n\n - [CLI](https://github.com/ngryman/ribs/wiki/CLI)\n - [API REST](https://github.com/ngryman/ribs/wiki/API-REST)\n - Middleware\n - [Node module](https://github.com/ngryman/ribs/wiki/API-Node-module)\n - [C++](https://github.com/ngryman/ribs/wiki/API-cpp)\n\n## Contact\n\n - Twitter: https://twitter.com/getribs\n - Mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/getribs\n - Issues: https://github.com/ngryman/ribs/issues\n\n[npm-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/v/ribs.svg\n[npm-url]: https://www.npmjs.org/package/ribs\n[travis-image]: http://img.shields.io/travis/ngryman/ribs.svg\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/ngryman/ribs\n[codeclimate-image]: http://img.shields.io/codeclimate/github/ngryman/ribs.svg\n[codeclimate-url]: https://codeclimate.com/github/ngryman/ribs\n[gemnasium-image]: http://img.shields.io/gemnasium/ngryman/ribs.png\n[gemnasium-url]: https://gemnasium.com/ngryman/ribs\n[gittip-image]: http://img.shields.io/gittip/ngryman.svg\n[gittip-url]: https://www.gittip.com/ngryman\n","created":"2013-08-04T21:34:21.723Z","modified":"2014-04-13T18:34:45.533Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"ngryman","email":"ngryman@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"ngryman","email":"ngryman@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"ribs","_npmUser":{"name":"ngryman","email":"ngryman@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.3","_rev":"1-90de2f298a6622087dc3fdc44d25e96e","author":{"name":"Nicolas Gryman","email":"ngryman@gmail.com","url":"http://ngryman.sh"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ngryman/ribs/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"9a02542f0acfba262931eceab2516cd52fbfc2a2","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/ribs/-/ribs-0.0.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"ngryman","email":"ngryman@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-04-13T18:34:45.533Z","created":"2013-08-04T21:34:21.723Z","0.0.0":"2013-08-04T21:34:29.599Z","0.0.1":"2014-03-04T22:45:17.195Z","0.0.2":"2014-03-19T21:57:56.520Z","0.0.3":"2014-04-13T18:34:45.533Z"}}}
