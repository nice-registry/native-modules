Receive the screen position of various mouse events. The events are also emitted while another application is in the foreground.\n\nTested in OS X 10.10 with node versions `0.10` and `0.12`, and latest `iojs`.\n\n\tnpm install osx-mouse\n\n# Usage\n\nThe module returns an event emitter instance.\n\n```javascript\nvar mouse = require('osx-mouse')();\n\nmouse.on('move', function(x, y) {\n\tconsole.log(x, y);\n});\n```\n\nThe program will not terminate as long as a mouse listener is active. To allow the program to exit, either call `mouse.unref` (works as `unref`/`ref` on a TCP server) or `mouse.destroy()`.\n\nThe events emitted are: `move`, `left-down`, `left-up`, `left-drag`, `right-up`, `right-down` and `right-drag`. For each event the screen coordinates are passed to the handler function.\n","starsCount":2,"created":"2015-05-03T23:14:35.003Z","modified":"2016-04-20T21:12:52.061Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"kapetan","email":"mirza.kapetanovic@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"kapetan","email":"mirza.kapetanovic@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"osx-mouse","_nodeVersion":"4.2.6","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/osx-mouse-1.2.1.tgz_1461186769949_0.8946442301385105"},"_npmUser":{"name":"kapetan","email":"mirza.kapetanovic@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.12","_rev":"1-034bb505dba6425513b6608c2471cfa1","_shasum":"ccdd4dbefd3293cbc4fb77301eab137cbe1ac85c","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/kapetan/osx-mouse/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.2.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"ccdd4dbefd3293cbc4fb77301eab137cbe1ac85c","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/osx-mouse/-/osx-mouse-1.2.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"kapetan","email":"mirza.kapetanovic@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-04-20T21:12:52.061Z","created":"2015-05-03T23:14:35.003Z","1.0.0":"2015-05-03T23:14:35.003Z","1.0.1":"2015-05-04T17:59:54.947Z","1.0.2":"2015-05-07T19:06:15.232Z","1.1.0":"2015-05-16T18:36:44.913Z","1.1.1":"2015-05-20T21:24:50.721Z","1.1.2":"2015-09-16T20:49:15.734Z","1.2.0":"2016-01-26T09:19:47.480Z","1.2.1":"2016-04-20T21:12:52.061Z"},"users":{"rchk":true,"vb078":true}}}
