Only take properties that you're interested in.\n* Output is a ready to use JS object.\n* Work on all major platforms (OS X, Linux and Windows). See Travis CI and AppVeyor build status for details.\n* SUPER FAST!! We're using [pugixml](http://pugixml.org/) underneath. It's one of the fastest xml parser around.\n\nHere are the benchmarks:\n\n```\ncamaro x 513 ops/sec ±0.86% (86 runs sampled)\nrapidx2j x 175 ops/sec ±0.91% (79 runs sampled)\nxml2json x 21.61 ops/sec ±0.83% (39 runs sampled)\nxml2js x 21.64 ops/sec ±6.27% (41 runs sampled)\nfast-xml-parser x 87.52 ops/sec ±3.49% (64 runs sampled)\n```\n\n* Please note that this is an unfair game for camaro because it only transform what it needs.\nThe whole reason of me creating this is because most of the time, I'm just interested in some of the data in the whole XML mess.\n\n* Benchmark run with Intel Core i5-5257U CPU @ 2.70GHz using Node v7.10.0\n\n* I may expose another method to transform the whole XML tree so that the benchmark will better reflect the real performance.\n\n![intro](intro.png)\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install camaro\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can use our custom template format powered by [XPath](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath).\n\nWe also introduce some custom syntax such as:\n\n* if a path start with `#`, that means it's a constant. E.g: `#1234` will return `1234`\n* if a path is empty, return blank\n\nThe rest are pretty much vanilla XPath 1.0.\n\n\n```js\nconst transform = require('camaro')\nconst fs = require('fs')\n\nconst xml = fs.readFileSync('examples/ean.xml', 'utf-8')\nconst template = {\n    cache_key: '/HotelListResponse/cacheKey',\n    hotels: ['//HotelSummary', {\n        hotel_id: 'hotelId',\n        name: 'name',\n        rooms: ['RoomRateDetailsList/RoomRateDetails', {\n            rates: ['RateInfos/RateInfo', {\n                currency: 'ChargeableRateInfo/@currencyCode',\n                non_refundable: 'boolean(nonRefundable = \"true\")',\n                price: 'number(ChargeableRateInfo/@total)'\n            }],\n            room_name: 'roomDescription',\n            room_type_id: 'roomTypeCode'\n        }]\n    }],\n    session_id: '/HotelListResponse/customerSessionId'\n}\n\nconst result = transform(xml, template)\n```\n\n## Licence\n\nThe MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2017 Tuan Anh Tran https://tuananh.org\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
