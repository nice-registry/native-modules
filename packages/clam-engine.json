It allows you to scan files for viruses in-process, without requiring a running instance of `clamd`, or imposing the startup time of the `clamscan` command.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Dependencies\n\nClam Engine requires `libclamav` to be present.\n\n- Ubuntu: `apt-get install libclamav-dev clamav-freshclam`\n- Homebew (OS X): `brew install clamav`\n\n### Via NPM\n\nJust run `npm install clam-engine`. Clam Engine supports Node.js 0.10, 0.11 and 0.12 as well as io.js. If something doesn't work for you using one of those runtimes, please file a bug.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Updating Signatures\n\nIn order for Clam Engine to work, you need to update the clamav virus signatures by running the `freshclam` command. You will need to configure it firsy.\n\n### Example\n\n    var clam = require('clam-engine');\n    \n    clam.createEngine(function (err, engine) {\n      if (err) {\n        return console.log('Error', err);\n      }\n      engine.scanFile('eicar.com', function (err, virus) {\n        if (err) {\n          return console.log('Error', err);\n        }\n        if (virus) {\n          return console.log('Virus', virus);\n        }\n        console.log('Clean');\n      });\n    });\n\n### API\n\n- #### `clam.createEngine(cb)`\n  Creates and initialises a new engine. The callback is called with `(err, engine)`.\n\n- #### `engine.version`\n  Property that contains the version of the underlying clamav engine.\n\n- #### `engine.signatures`\n  Propery that indicates the number of signatures loaded.\n\n- #### `engine.scanFile(filename, cb)`\n  Scans a file for a virus. The callback is called with `(err, virus)`. `virus` is null if the file is clean.\n","created":"2015-03-21T12:37:28.452Z","modified":"2015-11-25T00:11:03.577Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"srijs","email":"recv@awesam.de"},"owners":[{"name":"srijs","email":"recv@awesam.de"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"clam-engine","_nodeVersion":"4.2.2","_npmUser":{"name":"srijs","email":"recv@awesam.de"},"_npmVersion":"3.4.0","_rev":"1-706a58cb3690a71c5fca0cd954a0f588","_shasum":"ad94dfa8e1d966d13e200dfd5d794f15425bccc5","author":{"name":"Sam Rijs"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/srijs/node-clam-engine/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"2.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"ad94dfa8e1d966d13e200dfd5d794f15425bccc5","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/clam-engine/-/clam-engine-2.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"srijs","email":"recv@awesam.de"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-11-25T00:11:03.577Z","created":"2015-03-21T12:37:28.452Z","1.0.0":"2015-03-21T12:37:28.452Z","1.0.1":"2015-03-21T12:39:55.024Z","1.0.2":"2015-03-21T13:32:16.929Z","1.0.3":"2015-03-21T16:29:20.765Z","1.0.4":"2015-03-22T03:59:50.732Z","2.0.0":"2015-11-11T22:43:49.737Z","2.0.1":"2015-11-25T00:11:03.577Z"}}}
