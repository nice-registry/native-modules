We are\ntrying to provide a smooth way for developers rather than specifying a lot of \ncommand line arguments.\n\nIt supports NW.js starts from v0.3.2 and **users need to manually specify the\nversion of NW.js currently**.\n\n\n#### Features:\n\n * Easy to use, consistent interface\n * Same commands to build your module on every platform\n * Supports multiple target versions of Node\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou can install with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install -g nw-gyp\n```\n\nYou will also need to install:\n\n  * On Unix:\n    * `python` (`v2.7` recommended, `v3.x.x` is __*not*__ supported)\n    * `make`\n    * A proper C/C++ compiler toolchain, like [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org)\n  * On Mac OS X:\n    * `python` (`v2.7` recommended, `v3.x.x` is __*not*__ supported) (already installed on Mac OS X)\n    * [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/)\n      * You also need to install the `Command Line Tools` via Xcode. You can find this under the menu `Xcode -> Preferences -> Downloads`\n      * This step will install `gcc` and the related toolchain containing `make`\n  * On Windows:\n    * Visual C++ Build Environment:\n      * Option 1: Install [Visual C++ Build Tools](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools) using the **Default Install** option.\n\n      * Option 2: Install [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs) (or modify an existing installation) and select *Common Tools for Visual C++* during setup. This also works with the free Community and Express for Desktop editions.\n\n      > :bulb: [Windows Vista / 7 only] requires [.NET Framework 4.5.1](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40773)\n\n    * Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (`v3.x.x` is not supported), and run `npm config set python python2.7` (or see below for further instructions on specifying the proper Python version and path.)\n    * Launch cmd, `npm config set msvs_version 2015`\n\n    If the above steps didn't work for you, please visit [Microsoft's Node.js Guidelines for Windows](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejs-guidelines/blob/master/windows-environment.md#compiling-native-addon-modules) for additional tips.\n\nIf you have multiple Python versions installed, you can identify which Python\nversion `nw-gyp` uses by setting the '--python' variable:\n\n``` bash\n$ nw-gyp --python /path/to/python2.7\n```\n\nIf `nw-gyp` is called by way of `npm` *and* you have multiple versions of\nPython installed, then you can set `npm`'s 'python' config key to the appropriate\nvalue:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm config set python /path/to/executable/python2.7\n```\n\nNote that OS X is just a flavour of Unix and so needs `python`, `make`, and C/C++.\nAn easy way to obtain these is to install XCode from Apple,\nand then use it to install the command line tools (under Preferences -> Downloads).\n\nHow to Use\n----------\n\nTo compile your native addon, first go to its root directory:\n\n``` bash\n$ cd my_node_addon\n```\n\nThe next step is to generate the appropriate project build files for the current\nplatform. Use `configure` for that:\n\n``` bash\n$ nw-gyp configure --target=<0.3.2 or other nw version>\n```\n\n__Note__: The `configure` step looks for the `binding.gyp` file in the current\ndirectory to process. See below for instructions on creating the `binding.gyp` file.\n\nNow you will have either a `Makefile` (on Unix platforms) or a `vcxproj` file\n(on Windows) in the `build/` directory. Next invoke the `build` command:\n\n``` bash\n$ nw-gyp build\n```\n\nNow you have your compiled `.node` bindings file! The compiled bindings end up\nin `build/Debug/` or `build/Release/`, depending on the build mode. At this point\nyou can require the `.node` file with Node and run your tests!\n\n__Note:__ To create a _Debug_ build of the bindings file, pass the `--debug` (or\n`-d`) switch when running either the `configure`, `build` or `rebuild` command.\n\n__Note:__ nw.js is packed with Node.js version 0.11.13 and a different version of V8 (3.28.71.2) than the one Node.js 0.11.13 has (3.24.35.22), it might lead to some inconsistent behaviour when building your native modules (see [rvagg/nan#285][nanrepo]).\n\n\nThe \"binding.gyp\" file\n----------------------\n\nPreviously when node had `node-waf` you had to write a `wscript` file. The\nreplacement for that is the `binding.gyp` file, which describes the configuration\nto build your module in a JSON-like format. This file gets placed in the root of\nyour package, alongside the `package.json` file.\n\nA barebones `gyp` file appropriate for building a node addon looks like:\n\n``` python\n{\n  \"targets\": [\n    {\n      \"target_name\": \"binding\",\n      \"sources\": [ \"src/binding.cc\" ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nSome additional resources for addons and writing `gyp` files:\n\n * [\"Going Native\" a nodeschool.io tutorial](http://nodeschool.io/#goingnative)\n * [\"Hello World\" node addon example](https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/master/test/addons/hello-world)\n * [gyp user documentation](https://gyp.gsrc.io/docs/UserDocumentation.md)\n * [gyp input format reference](https://gyp.gsrc.io/docs/InputFormatReference.md)\n * [*\"binding.gyp\" files out in the wild* wiki page](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/wiki/%22binding.gyp%22-files-out-in-the-wild)\n\n\nCommands\n--------\n\n`nw-gyp` responds to the following commands:\n\n| **Command**   |
