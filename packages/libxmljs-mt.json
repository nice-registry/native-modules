 // prints \"grandchild content\"\n\nvar children = xmlDoc.root().childNodes();\nvar child = children[0];\n\nconsole.log(child.attr('foo').value()); // prints \"bar\"\n```\n\n## Support\n\n* Docs - [http://github.com/libxmljs/libxmljs/wiki](http://github.com/libxmljs/libxmljs/wiki)\n* Mailing list - [http://groups.google.com/group/libxmljs](http://groups.google.com/group/libxmljs)\n\n## API and Examples\n\nCheck out the wiki [http://github.com/libxmljs/libxmljs/wiki](http://github.com/libxmljs/libxmljs/wiki).\n\nSee the [examples](https://github.com/gagern/libxmljs/tree/master/examples) folder.\n\n## Installation via [npm](https://npmjs.org)\n\n```shell\nnpm install libxmljs-mt\n```\n\n## Contribute\n\nStart by checking out the open issues both for [the upstream project](https://github.com/libxmljs/libxmljs/issues?state=open) and the [multi-threaded fork](https://github.com/gagern/libxmljs/issues?state=open). Specifically the [desired feature](https://github.com/libxmljs/libxmljs/issues?labels=desired+feature&page=1&state=open) ones.\n\n### Requirements\n\nMake sure you have met the requirements for [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp#installation). You *do not* need to manually install node-gyp; it comes bundled with node.\n","created":"2015-07-10T08:44:51.733Z","modified":"2017-07-30T23:59:23.689Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"gagern","email":"Martin.vGagern@gmx.net"},"owners":[{"name":"gagern","email":"Martin.vGagern@gmx.net"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"libxmljs-mt","_nodeVersion":"8.2.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/libxmljs-mt-0.18.3.tgz_1501459161868_0.17996542830951512"},"_npmUser":{"name":"gagern","email":"Martin.vGagern@gmx.net"},"_npmVersion":"5.3.0","_rev":"2-b7cc8663b0c321f575f00b01010f25f0","author":{"name":"Marco Rogers"},"bugs":{"url":"http://github.com/gagern/libxmljs/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"Jeff Smick"},{"name":"Roman Shtylman"},{"name":"Martin von Gagern","email":"Martin.vGagern@gmx.net"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.18.3"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-brfyvfM4BJ8Hh53NyyFXJ+OgzerL6qsjTO3rJPd4RM8PeB8uhatmEODsY5zVP/a8yNYcfYLjOSFLhr8YzJCPnA==","shasum":"38f6069c38c2a64e348c49dd308abd41b9760857","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/libxmljs-mt/-/libxmljs-mt-0.18.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"gagern","email":"Martin.vGagern@gmx.net"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-07-30T23:59:23.689Z","created":"2015-07-10T08:44:51.733Z","0.14.2":"2015-07-10T08:44:51.733Z","0.14.3":"2015-08-05T00:18:31.814Z","0.14.4":"2015-08-31T01:12:41.508Z","0.14.5":"2015-08-31T13:59:36.811Z","0.15.0":"2015-11-16T00:18:02.422Z","0.15.1":"2015-11-16T01:56:00.593Z","0.15.2":"2015-11-16T09:43:37.200Z","0.16.0":"2016-01-06T16:58:06.666Z","0.16.1":"2016-01-07T23:11:30.182Z","0.17.0":"2016-01-25T07:56:58.514Z","0.17.1":"2016-02-09T12:02:05.486Z","0.17.2":"2016-06-02T22:10:08.518Z","0.18.0":"2016-06-02T23:05:34.263Z","0.18.3":"2017-07-30T23:59:23.689Z"}}}
