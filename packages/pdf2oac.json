The patches allow handling stamp annotations and rendering annotations to images. They can be found in the `libpoppler/patches` directory.\n\nTo patch and build the patched libpoppler, and then build the Node extension, all you need to do is run `npm install`. However, for this to run successfully will require several dependencies to be installed through your OS's package manager:\n\n  * libcairo\n  * libglib2.0\n  * libpixman\n  * libfreetype2\n  * libpng\n\n# Node.js library\n\n## Example\n\n```js\nconst pdf2oac = require('pdf2oac')\n\npdf2oac('~/Documents/annotated_document.pdf')\n  .on('data', triple => {\n    console.log(triple);\n  })\n  .on('close', () => {\n    console.log('all done!');\n  })\n```\n\n## Methods\n\n```js\nconst pdf2oac = require('pdf2oac')\n```\n\n### pdf2oac(pdfFilename, options={})\n\nReturns a ReadableStream that will extract annotations from the given pdf and stream objects with `subject`, `predicate`, `object`, and possibly `graph` attributes.\n\nAvailable options (all optional):\n\n  * `imageDirectory`: pdf2oac uses the program [`pdfimages`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pdfimages) (packaged with poppler-utils) to extract annotation images. If this option is provided, the given directory will be used to temporarily store the image files produced by `pdfimages`. If it is omitted, a temporary directory will be created automatically and deleted after completion.\n\n  * `pdfURI`: The URI that will be used as the RDF resource representing the PDF file. Defaults to `file://$pdfFilename`.\n\n  * `baseURI`: The base URI for all generated triples. Defaults to `http://example.org/#`.\n\n  * `graphURI`: If provided, the returned stream will emit quads (`{ subject, predicate, object, graph }`) with the given graph URI rather than triples (`{ subject, predicate, object }`).\n\n\n# Command line utility\n\n```\npdf2oac ~/Documents/annotated_document.pdf --format turtle > annotations.ttl\n```\n\nAvailable options:\n\n  * `--pdf-uri`: Same as pdfURI, above.\n\n  * `--baseURI`: Same as baseURI, above.\n\n  * `--graphURI`: Same as graphURI, above.\n\n  * `-f`, `--format`: The output format. One of `turtle`, `trig`, `n-triples`, `n-quads`, or `json`. Default is `trig` if graph URI is provided, or `turtle` if not. `json` does *not* return JSON-LD. Rather, it outputs `{ subject, predicate, object, ?graph }` triples/quads.\n","created":"2016-12-02T01:56:39.058Z","modified":"2017-04-26T01:43:13.679Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"ptgolden","email":"ptgolden0@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"ptgolden","email":"ptgolden0@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"pdf2oac","_nodeVersion":"7.9.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/pdf2oac-6.2.1.tgz_1493170992998_0.31238585617393255"},"_npmUser":{"name":"ptgolden","email":"ptgolden0@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.2.0","_rev":"18-ada76efef1eaefb6b6998c41251b269d","_shasum":"c36b8611bc9af7999f6f44e608f2dc9fa5e09720","author":"","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ptgolden/pdf2oac-js/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"6.2.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"c36b8611bc9af7999f6f44e608f2dc9fa5e09720","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/pdf2oac/-/pdf2oac-6.2.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"ptgolden","email":"ptgolden0@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-04-26T01:43:13.679Z","created":"2016-12-02T01:56:39.058Z","1.0.0":"2016-12-02T01:56:39.058Z","2.0.0":"2016-12-24T22:16:56.959Z","3.0.0":"2017-04-03T15:57:49.065Z","3.0.1":"2017-04-03T16:00:17.952Z","3.0.2":"2017-04-03T16:17:14.766Z","3.0.3":"2017-04-03T16:20:48.656Z","4.0.0":"2017-04-05T01:38:06.708Z","4.0.1":"2017-04-05T01:50:23.453Z","5.1.0":"2017-04-05T18:43:41.384Z","5.2.0":"2017-04-05T18:44:03.756Z","5.3.0":"2017-04-15T21:24:33.571Z","5.4.0":"2017-04-15T22:28:21.955Z","5.5.0":"2017-04-19T18:40:39.674Z","6.0.0":"2017-04-25T17:34:09.649Z","6.0.1":"2017-04-25T17:39:32.510Z","6.1.0":"2017-04-25T18:08:34.509Z","6.2.0":"2017-04-25T18:28:39.926Z","6.2.1":"2017-04-26T01:43:13.679Z"}}}
