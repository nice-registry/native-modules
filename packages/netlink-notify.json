Use at your own risk.\n\n### Have questions? Found a bug?\n\nPlease submit issues to the Github issue tracker\n","created":"2016-08-11T18:51:13.600Z","modified":"2016-08-26T12:17:40.513Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"derfel","email":"derfel+npmjs@derfel.net"},"owners":[{"name":"derfel","email":"derfel+npmjs@derfel.net"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"netlink-notify","_nodeVersion":"4.4.7","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/netlink-notify-0.2.4.tgz_1472213859671_0.3643593539018184"},"_npmUser":{"name":"derfel","email":"derfel+npmjs@derfel.net"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.5","_rev":"1-d2b4d45748e86752abd7ce47d64fa8be","_shasum":"0c72c5a5a72e4c0da38d43788430bb140de1a971","author":{"name":"Federico Stella","email":"code@derfel.net"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/derfel/netlink-notify/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.2.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"0c72c5a5a72e4c0da38d43788430bb140de1a971","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/netlink-notify/-/netlink-notify-0.2.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"derfel","email":"derfel+npmjs@derfel.net"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-08-26T12:17:40.513Z","created":"2016-08-11T18:51:13.600Z","0.1.0":"2016-08-11T18:51:13.600Z","0.1.1":"2016-08-13T12:56:21.595Z","0.1.2":"2016-08-14T14:15:49.876Z","0.2.0":"2016-08-16T23:08:44.339Z","0.2.1":"2016-08-16T23:54:17.255Z","0.2.2":"2016-08-24T09:35:02.881Z","0.2.3":"2016-08-25T08:51:22.202Z","0.2.4":"2016-08-26T12:17:40.513Z"}}}
