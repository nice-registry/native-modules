[#8]\n\n## 0.2.0\n- Supporting intermediate certificate [#5]\n\n## 0.1.0\n- [NaN](https://github.com/rvagg/nan) 2 [#4]\n- Node 4.x support\n\n## 0.0.2\n- Node.js v0.12 support\n- Using [NaN](https://github.com/rvagg/nan) for binding abstraction\n\n## 0.0.1\n- First version.\n\n# Credits\n- [@KenanSulayman](https://github.com/KenanSulayman) for node 0.12 + NaN support (v0.0.2)\n- [@dezinezync](https://github.com/dezinezync) for adding support to intermediate certificates (v0.2.0)\n\n# License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 MySiteApp Ltd.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
