Since D2 App Base includes these dependencies, it's best\nnot to include them in your app as well. That way you don't risk ending up with multiple versions of the packages in\nyour `node_modules`.\n\n`yarn remove webpack html-webpack-plugin d2-manifest eslint eslint-config-dhis2`\n\nOr:\n\n`npm remove --save webpack html-webpack-plugin d2-manifest`\n\nThen install this package:\n\n`yarn add d2-app-base` or\n`npm install --save d2-app-base`\n\nAfter all dependencies have been installed, the post-install script will create the following NPM scripts:\n\n- `start`: Starts webpack-dev-server on localhost port 8081 (by default)\n- `build`: Packages the app into the `build/` folder. This also runs `prebuild` and `postbuild` which will clean up any\n  previous builds, validate and lint your code, and copy additional files.\n- `deploy`: Deploy a new version of the app to Sonatype. This runs the `build` script first.\n\nAt this point, if you're lucky everything will just work. Start the dev server with `yarn start` (or `npm start`), bump\nthe version number with `yarn version`, and deploy new versions of your app with `yarn deploy`.\n\nMore likely you'll have to make some small adjustments to the webpack config (`webpack.config.js`), the html template\n(`index.html`) or the npm scripts (`package.json`). For example you may have to adjust the `postbuild` script in\n`package.json` to ensure that all the necessary files are copied to the `build/` folder. **Note:** You shouldn't copy\n`index.html` since this will be generated by `HtmlWebpackPlugin`.\n\nYou may also have to fix a ton of eslint errors. Please do fix them rather than disabling the linting, but feel free to\nsuggest changes to the eslint config if certain rules are causing problems. You may also override the rules in each\nrepo/folder by changing `.eslintrc`\n\n\n## Webpack config\n\nBy default, webpack will use `./src/index.js` as the entry point of your app, and the name of the output bundle will be\n`[name]-[hash].js`, where `[name]` will be replaced with the name of your entry point (defaults to \"main\") and `[hash]`\nwill be replaced with a unique hash. Since the filename can't be known ahead of time, the HTML Webpack plugin is used\nto generate an `index.html` that loads the correct file(s).\n\nThe default webpack config simply calls `makeWebpackConfig()` which is defined in\n[makeWebpackConfig.js](makeWebpackConfig.js). If you need to make changes to the webpack config, you can simply alter\nthe object returned by this function. For example you can generate two output bundles by replacing the `entry` member:\n \n```\nconst makeWebpackConfig = require('d2-app-base/makeWebpackConfig');\n\nconst webpackConfig = makeWebpackConfig(__dirname);\n\nwebpackConfig.entry = {\n    'app': './src/app.js',\n    'map': './src/map.js'\n};\n\nmodule.exports = webpackConfig;\n```\n\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThis package includes certain dependencies _on behalf_ of your app. If your app includes different versions of these\ndependencies you may end up with multiple versions in your `node_modules` folder. This can lead to weird bugs and\nunpredictable behavior.\n\nTherefore, it's recommended that you remove the following dependencies from your app:\n\n- webpack\n- html-webpack-plugin\n- d2-manifest\n- eslint\n- eslint-config-dhis2\n","created":"2016-12-15T19:00:21.795Z","modified":"2016-12-15T19:00:21.795Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"nicolayr","email":"nicolayr@ifi.uio.no"},"owners":[{"name":"nicolayr","email":"nicolayr@ifi.uio.no"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"d2-app-base","_nodeVersion":"6.5.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/d2-app-base-1.0.0-rc.0.tgz_1481828419899_0.27078463649377227"},"_npmUser":{"name":"nicolayr","email":"nicolayr@ifi.uio.no"},"_npmVersion":"4.0.3","_rev":"1-ababb2b2f42f264b29bad64c1bc857bf","_shasum":"b434694318e3c63cc7bf797a8d2d867baa9a261f","author":{"name":"Nicolay Ramm","email":"nicolay@dhis2.org"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0-rc.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"b434694318e3c63cc7bf797a8d2d867baa9a261f","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/d2-app-base/-/d2-app-base-1.0.0-rc.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"nicolayr","email":"nicolayr@ifi.uio.no"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-12-15T19:00:21.795Z","created":"2016-12-15T19:00:21.795Z","1.0.0-rc.0":"2016-12-15T19:00:21.795Z"}}}
