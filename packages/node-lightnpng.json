As in, PING! Your PNG is ready before you can\nsay lightning.\n\n# Usage\n\nFirst, install it in your project: `npm install --save node-lightnpng`\n\nThen use it.\n\n```\n'use strict'\n\n// For this example, we'll build an ARGB Buffer with node-canvas:\n// https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas\nconst Canvas = require('canvas')\nconst canvas = new Canvas(640, 480)\nconst ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')\n\nctx.fillStyle = 'red'\nctx.fillRect(10, 10, 200, 340)\nctx.fillStyle = 'green'\nctx.fillRect(50, 50, 30, 400);\n\nconst cairoBuf = canvas.toBuffer('raw') // ARGB, native-endian data\n\n// Now's where this library comes in: let's create a PNG!\nconst lightnpng = require('node-lightnpng')\nvar png = lightnpng.native_argb32_to_png(\n  cairoBuf,\n  640,          // width (in px)\n  480,          // height (in px)\n  canvas.stride // number of bytes per row of image\n)\n```\n\n# Design philosophy\n\nWe start with zero features.\n\nFeatures that don't inhibit speed are great.\n\nFor features that _do_ slow things down, apply the rule: a 5 percent slowdown\nshould make this library useful to three times as many people as already use it.\n\n## Options\n\nBasically, we allow no options at all ... _except_:\n\n* Custom width, height and row stride\n* Input conversion from ARGB32 to RGB24 by dropping the alpha channel\n\n### stride\n\nSome drawing libraries may align their arrays to machine word boundaries.\nThe `stride` option specifies how many bytes are in each row.\n\n# LICENSE\n\nBSD-style 2-clause license\n","created":"2016-10-08T20:51:01.419Z","modified":"2017-08-24T17:31:52.305Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"adamhooper","email":"adam@adamhooper.com"},"owners":[{"name":"adamhooper","email":"adam@adamhooper.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"node-lightnpng","_nodeVersion":"8.2.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/node-lightnpng-1.0.6.tgz_1503595912197_0.4921630516182631"},"_npmUser":{"name":"adamhooper","email":"adam@adamhooper.com"},"_npmVersion":"5.3.0","_rev":"5-25aa22cf5784699a6eaced2eacd792d2","author":{"name":"Adam Hooper","email":"adam.hooper@huffingtonpost.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/huffpostdata/node-lightnpng/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.6"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-Vx/jyeA43VqTX2Qe4ikZK8mKQpYq4DMZSFN4rYNAV27YRXSQSTLJBiArTSHGjJZVQxIe0UC3WxNW7z8vlyfd7w==","shasum":"1d8ae129fb60cb74fc48824476d682b14f43eef0","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/node-lightnpng/-/node-lightnpng-1.0.6.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"adamhooper","email":"adam@adamhooper.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-08-24T17:31:52.305Z","created":"2016-10-08T20:51:01.419Z","1.0.0":"2016-10-08T20:51:01.419Z","1.0.1":"2016-10-08T21:16:45.772Z","1.0.2":"2016-10-08T22:49:11.164Z","1.0.3":"2017-08-18T02:25:21.888Z","1.0.4":"2017-08-21T12:52:34.546Z","1.0.5":"2017-08-22T17:03:19.707Z","1.0.6":"2017-08-24T17:31:52.305Z"}}}
