So we recommend at least v0.7.5.\n\n- GLEW (http://glew.sourceforge.net/)\nGLEW is used to find OpenGL extensions in a cross-platform manner.\n\n- GLFW (http://www.glfw.org/)\nGLFW is a simple multi-platform framework for opening a window, creating an OpenGL context, and managing input.\n\nAll of these libraries are cross-platform. node-glfw provides a Javascript wrapper to access native methods in GLFW.\n\nOnce dependent libraries are installed, do\n```\nnpm install node-gyp\nnpm install --save bindings nan\nnode-gyp rebuild\n```\n\nInstallation (Mac)\n-------------------------\nUse Homebrew\n```\nbrew install pkg-config glfw3 glew\n```\n\nInstallation (Linux)\n-------------------------\nUse apt-get or similar package manager\n```\nsudo apt-get install libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libfreeimage-dev libglew-dev libxi-dev\n```\n\nDownload GLFW3 (do not use ```apt-get install libglfw-dev```, it is wrong version)\n```\ncd glfw\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ..\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\nInstallation (Windows)\n----------------------\n\nHave Visual Studio (Express version works fine) installed.\nWindows dependencies are bundled with this package, so `npm install node-glfw` should work out-of-box. The binary packages for Windows on their respective web site above do work as well but you'll need to change the path in ```bindings.gyp``` to point to where you installed them, includes and libs.\n\nNotes\n-----\n- node-glfw is a just a platform binding so don't expect samples here. You should install node-webgl, which contains lots of tests and examples using node-glfw features.\n- run ```node test/test.js``` to see a colored triangle with mouse tracking in the command-line. This indicates all is installed correctly.\n\n\n","created":"2017-01-23T06:26:14.927Z","modified":"2017-05-27T12:48:58.889Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"raub","email":"raubtierxxx@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"raub","email":"raubtierxxx@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"node-glfw-raub","_nodeVersion":"7.10.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/node-glfw-raub-0.5.0.tgz_1495889337959_0.24076971039175987"},"_npmUser":{"name":"raub","email":"raubtierxxx@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.1.2","_rev":"5-e60fba666cee0cea3a84836b1d382ae2","_shasum":"e199b3828f30e91c17687d61225617a23254b5dc","author":{"name":"Luis Blanco","email":"raubtierxxx@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/raub/node-glfw/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.5.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"e199b3828f30e91c17687d61225617a23254b5dc","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/node-glfw-raub/-/node-glfw-raub-0.5.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"raub","email":"raubtierxxx@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-05-27T12:48:58.889Z","created":"2017-01-23T06:26:14.927Z","0.4.6":"2017-01-23T06:26:14.927Z","0.4.7":"2017-01-23T18:39:46.104Z","0.4.8":"2017-02-15T14:53:13.403Z","0.4.9":"2017-02-19T07:23:02.581Z","0.5.0":"2017-05-27T12:48:58.889Z"}}}
