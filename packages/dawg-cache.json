One representation is mutable, and ported from a Python implementation [here](https://gist.github.com/smhanov/94230b422c2100ae4218), and the other is a very compact read-only representation meant to be used as an alternative to a hash table as a first-line membership cache in [carmen](https://github.com/mapbox/carmen/). The full version (the \"Dawg\" class) allows for insertion of keys, testing of set membership, and testing of a key being a prefix of a set member. The compact version allows only the latter two operations.\n","created":"2015-11-30T17:07:12.310Z","modified":"2017-03-14T00:13:49.425Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"apendleton","email":"andrew@mapbox.com"},"owners":[{"name":"apendleton","email":"andrew@mapbox.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"dawg-cache","_nodeVersion":"4.5.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/dawg-cache-0.4.2.tgz_1489450426806_0.11919529549777508"},"_npmUser":{"name":"apendleton","email":"andrew@mapbox.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.15.9","_rev":"5-b794cd4fe1c19d36b16a9ace762bce5a","_shasum":"f1686ed987a4ce2a131d56573b1b3458fbf41074","directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.4.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"f1686ed987a4ce2a131d56573b1b3458fbf41074","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/dawg-cache/-/dawg-cache-0.4.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"apendleton","email":"andrew@mapbox.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-03-14T00:13:49.425Z","created":"2015-11-30T17:07:12.310Z","0.2.0":"2015-11-30T17:07:12.310Z","0.3.0":"2016-04-14T23:09:29.543Z","0.3.1":"2016-04-15T02:08:08.081Z","0.3.2":"2016-12-07T22:16:54.990Z","0.4.0":"2017-02-22T21:53:58.888Z","0.4.1":"2017-02-23T04:39:17.180Z","0.4.2":"2017-03-14T00:13:49.425Z"}}}
