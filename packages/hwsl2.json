It holds:\n\n    Hash.hash(m1 + m2, function (err, h) {\n      Hash.hash(m1, function (err, h1) {\n        Hash.hash(m2, function (err, h2) {\n          assert(h.equals(h1.concat(h2)));\n        });\n      );\n    });\n\nFollowing that, the hash function is also parallelisable. If a message `m` can be divided into a list of chunks `cs`, the hash of the message can be calculated in parallel:\n\n    async.map(cs, Hash.hash, function (err, hs) {\n      hs.reduce(function (a, b) { return a.concat(b); }, Hash.empty());\n    });\n\nAll operations in this package are implemented in a very efficient manner using SSE instructions.\n\n![diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srijs/hwsl2-core/master/cat.png)\n","created":"2015-07-11T06:35:08.141Z","modified":"2015-07-11T06:35:08.141Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"srijs","email":"recv@awesam.de"},"owners":[{"name":"srijs","email":"recv@awesam.de"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"hwsl2","_nodeVersion":"0.10.33","_npmUser":{"name":"srijs","email":"recv@awesam.de"},"_npmVersion":"2.1.12","_rev":"1-eb567d53213b6c8d1e2ea03c3dc43108","_shasum":"b346d05ea9dca93d1a79789dcefcc3ab22e66148","author":{"name":"Sam Rijs"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/srijs/hwsl2-node/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"b346d05ea9dca93d1a79789dcefcc3ab22e66148","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/hwsl2/-/hwsl2-1.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"srijs","email":"recv@awesam.de"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-07-11T06:35:08.141Z","created":"2015-07-11T06:35:08.141Z","1.0.0":"2015-07-11T06:35:08.141Z"}}}
