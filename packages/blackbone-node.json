Enumerate modules using Loader list/Section objects/PE headers methods.\r\n - Get exported function address\r\n - Get the main module\r\n - Unlink module from loader lists\r\n - Inject and eject modules (including pure IL images)\r\n - Inject 64bit modules into WOW64 processes\r\n - Manually map native PE images\r\n\r\n- **Threads**\r\n - Enumerate threads\r\n - Create and terminate threads. Support for cross-session thread creation.\r\n - Get thread exit code\r\n - Get main thread\r\n - Manage TEB32/TEB64\r\n - Join threads\r\n - Suspend and resume threads\r\n - Set/Remove hardware breakpoints\r\n\r\n- **Pattern search**\r\n - Search for arbitrary pattern in local or remote process\r\n \r\n- **Remote code execution**\r\n - Execute functions in remote process\r\n - Assemble own code and execute it remotely\r\n - Support for cdecl/stdcall/thiscall/fastcall conventions\r\n - Support for arguments passed by value, pointer or reference, including structures\r\n - FPU types are supported\r\n - Execute code in new thread or any existing one\r\n \r\n- **Remote hooking**\r\n - Hook functions in remote process using int3 or hardware breakpoints\r\n - Hook functions upon return\r\n \r\n- **Manual map features**\r\n - x86 and x64 image support\r\n - Mapping into any arbitrary unprotected process\r\n - Section mapping with proper memory protection flags\r\n - Image relocations (only 2 types supported. I haven't seen a single PE image with some other relocation types)\r\n - Imports and Delayed imports are resolved\r\n - Bound import is resolved as a side effect, I think\r\n - Module exports\r\n - Loading of forwarded export images\r\n - Api schema name redirection\r\n - SxS redirection and isolation\r\n - Activation context support\r\n - Dll path resolving similar to native load order\r\n - TLS callbacks. Only for one thread and only with PROCESS_ATTACH/PROCESS_DETACH reasons.\r\n - Static TLS\r\n - Exception handling support (SEH and C++)\r\n - Adding module to some native loader structures(for basic module api support: GetModuleHandle, GetProcAdress, etc.)\r\n - Security cookie initialization\r\n - C++/CLI images are supported\r\n - Image unloading \r\n - Increase reference counter for import libraries in case of manual import mapping\r\n - Cyclic dependencies are handled properly \r\n \r\n \r\n- **Driver features**\r\n- Allocate/free/protect user memory\r\n- Read/write user and kernel memory\r\n- Disable permanent DEP for WOW64 processes\r\n- Change process protection flag\r\n- Change handle access rights\r\n- Remap process memory\r\n- Hiding allocated user-mode memory\r\n- User-mode dll injection and manual mapping\r\n- Manual mapping of drivers\r\n\r\n## License ##\r\nBlackbone is licensed under the MIT License.
