node-cassandra-native-driver [![Build Status: Linux](https://travis-ci.org/jut-io/node-cassandra-native-driver.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jut-io/node-cassandra-native-driver)\n\nNode.js addon that wraps the [DataStax C++ cassandra driver](https://github.com/datastax/cpp-driver).\n\nFunctionally, this project is similar to [https://github.com/datastax/nodejs-driver] except that it offers better performance due to the fact that the protocol processing is performed in C++ and can thereby leverage other threads instead of just the main loop thread.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n    npm install cassandra-native-driver\n\nFeatures\n========\n\n* Exposes much of the native driver functionality, including regular, prepared, and batch statements as well as various configuration options.\n* Tuned for high performance, capable of 100,000s of operations per second under some circumstances.\n* Fully parallel execution model, including support for paging results.\n* Asynchronous logging handler that exposes C++ driver logs as Javascript callbacks.\n* Supports most basic cql types, including int, varchar, double, boolean, blob, counter, timestamp including a convenient type based on the Javascript type as well as an API to explicitly select the type.\n\nBasic Usage\n===========\n\n```\nvar cassandra = require('cassandra-native-driver');\nvar client = new cassandra.Client(options);\nclient.connect({address: \"10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2\"}, function(err) {\n    var cql = \"SELECT email from profile where username = ?\";\n    client.execute(cql, 'joe', function(err, results) {\n        console.log('got email', results.rows[0]);\n    });\n}\n```\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nTBD...\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nThe wrapper library and addon are licensed for distribution by the MIT License.\n\nThis repository also includes a copy of the DataStax C++ driver from https://github.com/datastax/cpp-driver which is covered by the Apache License.\n\nThis code has been slightly modified to include conditional compilation directives to enable it to be used within the context of a node.js addon.\n","created":"2014-12-31T20:23:11.184Z","modified":"2015-10-22T15:45:19.130Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"demmer","email":"demmer@jut.io"},"owners":[{"name":"demmer","email":"demmer@jut.io"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"cassandra-native-driver","_nodeVersion":"4.2.1","_npmUser":{"name":"demmer","email":"demmer@jut.io"},"_npmVersion":"3.3.8","_rev":"1-8df8d2d79f83821594095cf0c1b42866","_shasum":"095c31fa19ae75a58a980573d288d7b4708945e5","author":{"name":"Michael
