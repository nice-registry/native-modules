The colors are unsertain but fidelity.\n\nThe function is like below:\n\n```javascript\nvar thmclrx = require(\"thmclrx\");\nthmclrx.octree(file, [maxColors], [callback], [frameNumber]);\n```\n\n+ `file`: it could be a local filename, remote url or even an image buffer.\n+ `maxColors`: count of max theme colors you want to extract. Defaults to 256;\n+ `callback`: it should be like `function(err, colors) {}`. Defaults to an empty function;\n+ `frameNumber`: the frame you want to extract. Usually used in `gif`. Defaults to 0.\n\n### minDiff\n\n`minDiff` is to get theme colors in minimum differ algorithm by passing a palette. The result theme colors are certainlly in your palette.\n\n```javascript\nvar thmclrx = require(\"thmclrx\");\nthmclrx.minDiff(file, [palette], [callback], [frameNumber]);\n```\n\n+ `file`: it could be a local filename, remote url or even an image buffer.\n+ `palette`: palette is an array that in the struct of `[ { r: .., g: .., b: .., }, { r: .., g: .., b: .. } ]`. Default palette refers [here](https://github.com/XadillaX/thmclrx/blob/master/lib/default_palette.js).\n+ `callback`: it should be like `function(err, colors) {}`. Defaults to an empty function;\n+ `frameNumber`: the frame you want to extract. Usually used in `gif`. Defaults to 0.\n\n### mixed\n\nUsing `mixed` get the basic fidelity theme colors and then using `minDiff` to standardize the fidelity theme colors to a certain palette.\n\n```javascript\nvar thmclrx = require(\"thmclrx\");\nthmclrx.mixed(file, [firstStepMaxColors], [palette], [callback], [frameNumber]);\n```\n\n+ `file`: same as the two functions above.\n+ `firstStepMaxColors`: same as the `maxColors` in `octreeGet`. Defaults to 256.\n+ `palette`: same as the `palette` in `mindiffGet`. Same default value.\n+ `callback`: same as the two functions above.\n+ `frameNumber`: same as the two functions above.\n\n## C++ API\n\nIf you want to use C++ API directly, you can refer to this.\n\n### getByOctree\n\nThis function is called in `octree` in Node.js API.\n\n```javascript\nvar thmclrx = require(\"thmclrx\").cpp;\nvar colors = thmclrx.getByOctree(pixels, [maxColor]);\n```\n\n+ `pixels`: this is an array in the struct of `[ { r: .., g: .., b: .., }, { r: .., g: .., b: .. } ]`.\n+ `maxColor`: same as the `maxColors` in `octreeGet` of Node.js API. Defaults to 256.\n+ `@return`: this function will return the theme colors.\n\n### getByMinDiff\n\nThis function is called in `minDiff` in Node.js API.\n\n```javascript\nvar thmclrx = require(\"thmclrx\").cpp;\nvar colors = thmclrx.getByMinDiff(pixels, [palette]);\n```\n\n+ `pixels`: this may be same as the `pixels` in `octreeGet` of C++ API. Otherwise, it may be the result of `octreeGet` of C++ API.\n+ `palette`: same as the `palette` in `mindiffGet` of Node.js API. Same default value.\n+ `@return`: this function will return the theme colors.\n\n### getByMixed\n\nThis function is called in `mixed` in Node.js API.\n\n```javascript\nvar thmclrx = require(\"thmclrx\").cpp;\nvar colors = thmclrx.getByMixed(pixels, maxColors, palette);\n```\n\n+ `pixels`: this may be same as the `pixels` in `octreeGet` of C++ API. Otherwise, it may be the result of `octreeGet` of C++ API.\n+ `maxColors`: same as the `maxColors` in `octreeGet` of Node.js API.\n+ `palette`: same as the `palette` in `mindiffGet` of Node.js API.\n+ `@return`: this function will return the theme colors.\n\n## Migrate From 0.x To 1.x\n\nthmclrx 0.x has three APIs which map three APIs in 1.x.\n\n+ octreeGet\n+ mindiffGet\n+ mixGet\n\nIn 1.x, these three APIs still exist but deprecated. They are exactly shallow points of `octree` / `minDiff` and `mixed`.\n\nYou may do nothing but we recommend you to rename the functions you called.\n\nBut if you're using native APIs (C++ APIs), you should read the [new document](#c-api).\n\n## Contribute\n\nYou're welcome to fork and make pull requests!\n\n「雖然我覺得不怎麼可能有人會關注我」\n","starsCount":2,"created":"2014-09-17T02:38:10.804Z","modified":"2017-04-27T03:54:23.351Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"xadillax","email":"admin@xcoder.in"},"owners":[{"name":"xadillax","email":"admin@xcoder.in"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"thmclrx","_nodeVersion":"6.9.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/thmclrx-1.0.0.tgz_1493265263028_0.0592825417406857"},"_npmUser":{"name":"xadillax","email":"admin@xcoder.in"},"_npmVersion":"2.15.11","_rev":"3-b031992bb1ef06eda58dfbd17b3d827c","_shasum":"f43d305cceb595c9c004c3b742d20b4f8e0b39a8","author":{"name":"XadillaX"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/XadillaX/thmclrx/issues"},"directories":{"test":"test"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"f43d305cceb595c9c004c3b742d20b4f8e0b39a8","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/thmclrx/-/thmclrx-1.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"xadillax","email":"admin@xcoder.in"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-04-27T03:54:23.351Z","created":"2014-09-17T02:38:10.804Z","0.0.5":"2014-09-17T02:38:10.804Z","0.0.5-fixdeps":"2014-09-17T02:53:30.318Z","0.0.6":"2014-10-02T03:21:16.611Z","0.0.7":"2014-10-11T08:03:29.221Z","0.1.0-alpha":"2014-10-14T02:23:17.360Z","0.1.0-alpha2":"2014-10-14T02:35:52.268Z","0.1.0-alpha3":"2014-10-14T02:48:09.150Z","0.1.1":"2014-10-14T02:52:24.273Z","0.1.2":"2014-10-14T03:20:24.994Z","0.1.3":"2014-10-14T03:23:03.525Z","0.1.3-deps":"2014-10-14T07:10:12.817Z","0.1.4":"2014-10-18T05:46:35.541Z","0.1.5":"2014-10-19T05:08:14.840Z","0.2.0":"2014-12-10T07:13:06.878Z","0.2.1":"2014-12-16T08:59:09.140Z","0.2.5":"2014-12-17T16:12:26.021Z","0.2.6":"2015-01-07T02:05:28.703Z","0.3.0":"2015-01-19T06:41:58.246Z","0.3.1":"2015-04-21T07:26:13.952Z","0.3.2":"2015-04-23T09:42:42.282Z","0.3.3":"2015-05-11T05:43:23.557Z","0.4.0":"2015-10-09T06:05:55.184Z","1.0.0":"2017-04-27T03:54:23.351Z"},"users":{"jackiealex":true,"timerui":true}}}
