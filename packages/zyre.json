Sorry. Before running \"npm install\" you must build/install libsodium, libzmq, libczmq, and libzyre. Frankly it's simpler to build/install without using npm:\n\n```\nmkdir -p $HOME/temp\ncd $HOME/temp\ngit clone https://github.com/zeromq/zyre\ncd zyre/bindings/nodejs\n./build.sh\n```\n\nAnd then copy build/Release/zyre.node to the node_modules/ directory of whatever application you want to tey it in.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nThis package wraps the Zyre library for Node.js. Here is an example of use:\n\n```\nvar ZyreBinding = require ('bindings')('zyre');\nvar zyre = new ZyreBinding.Zyre ();\nconsole.log (\"Create Zyre node, uuid=\" + zyre.uuid () + \" name=\" + zyre.name ());\n\nzyre.start ();\nzyre.join (\"GLOBAL\");\nzyre.print ();\n\nwhile (true) {\n    var event = new ZyreBinding.ZyreEvent (zyre);\n    if (!event.defined ())\n        break;              //  Interrupted\n    event.print ();\n\n    if (event.type_name () == \"ENTER\") {\n        //  If new peer, say hello to it and wait for it to answer us\n        console.log (\"[\" + event.peer_name () + \"] peer entered\");\n        zyre.whisper (event.peer_uuid (), \"Hello\");\n    }\n    else\n    if (event.type_name () == \"EXIT\") {\n        console.log (\"[\" + event.peer_name () + \"] peer exited\");\n    }\n    else\n    if (event.type_name () == \"WHISPER\") {\n        console.log (\"[\" + event.peer_name () + \"] received ping (WHISPER)\");\n        zyre.shout (\"GLOBAL\", \"Hello\");\n    }\n    else\n    if (event.type_name () == \"SHOUT\") {\n        console.log (\"[\" + event.peer_name () + \"](\"\n                  + event.group () + \") received ping (SHOUT)\");\n    }\n    event.destroy ();\n}\nzyre.stop ();\nzyre.destroy ();\n```\n\n## Implementation\n\nThis is a wrapping of the native C libzyre library. See binding.cc for the code.\n\nWe get two classes:\n\n    Zyre        - a Zyre node instance\n    ZyreEvent   - an event from the Zyre network\n\nThe Zyre class has these methods:\n\n    destroy\n    defined\n    uuid\n    name\n    start\n    stop\n    setHeader (name, value)\n    setVerbose\n    join (group)\n    leave (group)\n    print\n    whisper (peer_uuid, message)\n    shout (group, message)\n    recv\n\nThe ZyreEvent class has these methods:\n\n    destroy\n    defined\n    type\n    type_name\n    peer_uuid\n    peer_name\n    peer_addr\n    header (name)\n    group\n    msg\n    print\n\n## Building from Source\n\n* You need Python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x not supported)\n* You need (ideally) nvm and Node.js.\n* If your Linux has an existing 'node' command, remove it. You need matching versions of node and node-gyp.\n* In every terminal, or .bashrc: `nvm use v5.5.0`\n\nTo install the necessary Node tools:\n\n```\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.11.1/install.sh | bash\n# close terminal, re-open\nnvm ls-remote\nnvm install v5.5.0\nnpm install -g node-gyp\nnpm install -g node-pre-gyp\n```\n\nTo build (in theory):\n\n```\nmkdir -p $HOME/temp\ncd $HOME/temp\ngit clone https://github.com/zeromq/zyre\ncd zyre/bindings/nodejs\n./build.sh\n```\n\n## Making Changes\n\nNote that this version of the binding is destined for destruction; we will replace it with one generated via zproject, with essentially the same API.\n\nHaving said that, fixes and improvements are welcome.
