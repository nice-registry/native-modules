With a few lines of code, recognize text found in images produced by scanners, cameras, or fax machines.\n## OCR with less than 20 lines of code \n\n  1. Make sure you have the following system requirements:\n      \n###### Linux *64 bit*\n\n   - `node -v` x64 4.0 or greater and npm.\n   - `gcc --version` 4.8.1 or greater.\n   - `g++ -v` 4.8.1 or greater.\n   - `java -version` x64 JRE 1.7 or later.\n\n###### Windows *64 bit*\n\n   - `node -v` x64 4.0 or greater and npm.\n   - `java -version` x64 JRE 1.7 or later.\n   - `python -V` 2.7.x\n   - `[Visual C++ Build Tools.](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools)\n\n2. Set node build tools *(Windows only)*\n   \n  - `npm config set python python2.7`\n  - `npm config set msvs_version 2015`\n\n3. Register an email address for a [free account](https://www.accusoft.com/products/ocr-xpress/get-it/) to get access to our OCRX evaluation version\n4. `npm install ocr` \n5. Run the license utility to install an evaluation license. When prompted enter the email you registered with in step 2: \n  - to launch window: \n\t  `cd node_modules/ocr && npm run register`\n - to register manually: \n\t   `cd node_modules/ocr && npm run register -- youremail@domain.com ` \n6. Use the following to get a taste of what OCRX can do:\n\n```js\nvar ocr = require('ocr');\n\n// Set default values. \nvar params = {\n    input: './node_modules/ocr/samples/images/color.bmp',\n    output: './out.txt',\n\tformat: 'text'\n};\n    \n// OCR the input image and output result to text file given by params.output\nocr.recognize(params, function(err, document){\n    if(err)\n        console.error(err);\n    else{        \n        //output the document object: \n        console.log(document); \n    }\n});\n```\n## Accessing Results\nThe Results Manager is a collection of *\"get\"* functions that returns an array of various result *objects*.\n\nFor example, to get the text of the first word recognized in the document:\n```js\nvar textLine = document.getWords()[0].text;\n```\nResulting objects return more than just text. The following provides access to characters, words, and the bounding box of the first line of text, inside the first region of text recognized in the document:\n```js\nvar textLine = document.getRegions()[0].getTextLines()[0];\n```\nIt is also possible to control the output of the result by adjusting recognition parameters. For example,\n```js\nvar params = {\n    output: './out.pdf',\n    format: 'pdf'\n};\n```\nThere are many other OCR capabilities such as page rotation, multiple supported languages, recognition confidence, and much more.\n## More Documentation and Support\n\nOCRX also includes detailed API documentation, a Getting started guide, and code samples\n\n- Navigate to the _node_modules/ocr/samples/_ directory and check out more code samples.\n- Need more documentation?
