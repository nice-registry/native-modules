Node.js native addon build tool\n\n`node-gyp` is a cross-platform command-line tool written in Node.js for compiling\nnative addon modules for Node.js.  It bundles the [gyp](https://gyp.gsrc.io)\nproject used by the Chromium team and takes away the pain of dealing with the\nvarious differences in build platforms. It is the replacement to the `node-waf`\nprogram which is removed for node `v0.8`. If you have a native addon for node that\nstill has a `wscript` file, then you should definitely add a `binding.gyp` file\nto support the latest versions of node.\n\nMultiple target versions of node are supported (i.e. `0.8`, ..., `4`, `5`, `6`,\netc.), regardless of what version of node is actually installed on your system\n(`node-gyp` downloads the necessary development files or headers for the target version).\n\n#### Features:\n\n * Easy to use, consistent interface\n * Same commands to build your module on every platform\n * Supports multiple target versions of Node\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou can install with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install -g node-gyp\n```\n\nYou will also need to install:\n\n  * On Unix:\n    * `python` (`v2.7` recommended, `v3.x.x` is __*not*__ supported)\n    * `make`\n    * A proper C/C++ compiler toolchain, like [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org)\n  * On Mac OS X:\n    * `python` (`v2.7` recommended, `v3.x.x` is __*not*__ supported) (already installed on Mac OS X)\n    * [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/)\n      * You also need to install the `Command Line Tools` via Xcode. You can find this under the menu `Xcode -> Preferences -> Downloads`\n      * This step will install `gcc` and the related toolchain containing `make`\n  * On Windows:\n    * Option 1: Install all the required tools and configurations using Microsoft's [windows-build-tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools) using `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools` from an elevated PowerShell or CMD.exe (run as Administrator).\n    * Option 2: Install tools and configuration manually:\n      * Visual C++ Build Environment:\n        * Option 1: Install [Visual C++ Build Tools](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools) using the **Default Install** option.\n\n        * Option 2: Install [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs) (or modify an existing installation) and select *Common Tools for Visual C++* during setup. This also works with the free Community and Express for Desktop editions.\n\n        > :bulb: [Windows Vista / 7 only] requires [.NET Framework 4.5.1](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40773)\n\n      * Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (`v3.x.x` is not supported), and run `npm config set python python2.7` (or see below for further instructions on specifying the proper Python version and path.)\n      * Launch cmd, `npm config set msvs_version 2015`\n\n    If the above steps didn't work for you, please visit [Microsoft's Node.js Guidelines for Windows](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejs-guidelines/blob/master/windows-environment.md#compiling-native-addon-modules) for additional tips.\n\nIf you have multiple Python versions installed, you can identify which Python\nversion `node-gyp` uses by setting the '--python' variable:\n\n``` bash\n$ node-gyp --python /path/to/python2.7\n```\n\nIf `node-gyp` is called by way of `npm` *and* you have multiple versions of\nPython installed, then you can set `npm`'s 'python' config key to the appropriate\nvalue:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm config set python /path/to/executable/python2.7\n```\n\nNote that OS X is just a flavour of Unix and so needs `python`, `make`, and C/C++.\nAn easy way to obtain these is to install XCode from Apple,\nand then use it to install the command line tools (under Preferences -> Downloads).\n\nHow to Use\n----------\n\nTo compile your native addon, first go to its root directory:\n\n``` bash\n$ cd my_node_addon\n```\n\nThe next step is to generate the appropriate project build files for the current\nplatform. Use `configure` for that:\n\n``` bash\n$ node-gyp configure\n```\n\nAuto-detection fails for Visual C++ Build Tools 2015, so `--msvs_version=2015`\nneeds to be added (not needed when run by npm as configured above):\n``` bash\n$ node-gyp configure --msvs_version=2015\n```\n\n__Note__: The `configure` step looks for the `binding.gyp` file in the current\ndirectory to process. See below for instructions on creating the `binding.gyp` file.\n\nNow you will have either a `Makefile` (on Unix platforms) or a `vcxproj` file\n(on Windows) in the `build/` directory. Next invoke the `build` command:\n\n``` bash\n$ node-gyp build\n```\n\nNow you have your compiled `.node` bindings file! The compiled bindings end up\nin `build/Debug/` or `build/Release/`, depending on the build mode. At this point\nyou can require the `.node` file with Node and run your tests!\n\n__Note:__ To create a _Debug_ build of the bindings file, pass the `--debug` (or\n`-d`) switch when running either the `configure`, `build` or `rebuild` command.\n\n\nThe \"binding.gyp\" file\n----------------------\n\nPreviously when node had `node-waf` you had to write a `wscript` file. The\nreplacement for that is the `binding.gyp` file, which describes the configuration\nto build your module in a JSON-like format. This file gets placed in the root of\nyour package, alongside the `package.json` file.\n\nA barebones `gyp` file appropriate for building a node addon looks like:\n\n``` python\n{\n  \"targets\": [\n    {\n      \"target_name\": \"binding\",\n      \"sources\": [ \"src/binding.cc\" ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nSome additional resources for addons and writing `gyp` files:\n\n * [\"Going Native\" a nodeschool.io tutorial](http://nodeschool.io/#goingnative)\n * [\"Hello World\" node addon example](https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/master/test/addons/hello-world)\n * [gyp user documentation](https://gyp.gsrc.io/docs/UserDocumentation.md)\n * [gyp input format reference](https://gyp.gsrc.io/docs/InputFormatReference.md)\n * [*\"binding.gyp\" files out in the wild* wiki page](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/wiki/%22binding.gyp%22-files-out-in-the-wild)\n\n\nCommands\n--------\n\n`node-gyp` responds to the following commands:\n\n| **Command**   | **Description**\n|:--------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------\n| `help`        | Shows the help dialog\n| `build`       | Invokes `make`/`msbuild.exe` and builds the native addon\n| `clean`       | Removes the `build` directory if it exists\n| `configure`   | Generates project build files for the current platform\n| `rebuild`     | Runs `clean`, `configure` and `build` all in a row\n| `install`     | Installs node header files for the given version\n| `list`        | Lists the currently installed node header versions\n| `remove`      | Removes the node header files for the given version\n\n\nCommand Options\n--------\n\n`node-gyp` accepts the following command options:\n\n| **Command**                       | **Description**\n|:----------------------------------|:------------------------------------------\n| `-j n`, `--jobs n`                | Run make in parallel\n| `--target=v6.2.1`                 | Node version to build for (default=process.version)\n| `--silly`, `--loglevel=silly`     | Log all progress to console\n| `--verbose`, `--loglevel=verbose` | Log most progress to console\n| `--silent`, `--loglevel=silent`   | Don't log anything to console\n| `debug`, `--debug`                | Make Debug build (default=Release)\n| `--release`, `--no-debug`         | Make Release build\n| `-C $dir`, `--directory=$dir`     | Run command in different directory\n| `--make=$make`                    | Override make command (e.g. gmake)\n| `--thin=yes`                      | Enable thin static libraries\n| `--arch=$arch`                    | Set target architecture (e.g. ia32)\n| `--tarball=$path`                 | Get headers from a local tarball\n| `--devdir=$path`                  | SDK download directory (default=~/.node-gyp)\n| `--ensure`                        | Don't reinstall headers if already present\n| `--dist-url=$url`                 | Download header tarball from custom URL\n| `--proxy=$url`                    | Set HTTP proxy for downloading header tarball\n| `--cafile=$cafile`                | Override default CA chain (to download tarball)\n| `--nodedir=$path`                 | Set the path to the node binary\n| `--python=$path`                  | Set path to the python (2) binary\n| `--msvs_version=$version`         | Set Visual Studio version (win)\n| `--solution=$solution`            | Set Visual Studio Solution version (win)\n\n\nConfiguration\n--------\n\n__`node-gyp` responds to environment variables or `npm` configuration__\n1. Environment variables take the form `npm_config_OPTION_NAME` for any of the \n options listed above (dashes in option names should be replaced by underscores).\n These work also when `node-gyp` is invoked directly:  \n `$ export npm_config_devdir=/tmp/.gyp`  \n or on Windows  \n `> set npm_config_devdir=c:\\temp\\.gyp`  \n2. As `npm` configuration, variables take the form `OPTION_NAME`.\n This way only works when `node-gyp` is executed by `npm`:  \n `$ npm config set [--global] devdir /tmp/.gyp`  \n `$ npm i buffertools`\n \n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person
