Using the hash input, the q24 algorithm simulates about 3500-7000 dice rolls to determine stats for the hero and hundreds or thousands of enemies. Each byte 1 through 24 represents the hero's HP at the end of each of the 24 quests.\n\nThis project was just for fun and presents no real cryptographic goals, although through normal usage I am convinced the algorithm is collision-free.\n\nRun ```make``` to build the npm module and CLI tool. The CLI tool is a simple binary q24sum that is placed in the bin folder. You can move this to /bin to make the ```q24sum``` command available system-wide.\n\n```\n$ q24sum -i \"three blind mice\"\n$ 3d164a33238d469757741a462ae5cd8ad41279ef421ce734\n```\n\nRun ```q24sum -h``` for more details.\n\n##Install\n\n```npm install q24```\n\nIf you have mocha, you can run the tests inside directory node_modules/q24 with the ```mocha``` command.\n\n##License\n\nMIT License\nhttp://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n","created":"2015-03-19T01:48:15.521Z","modified":"2015-09-13T23:41:51.258Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"austindebruyn","email":"austin.debruyn@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"austindebruyn","email":"austin.debruyn@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"q24","_nodeVersion":"4.0.0","_npmUser":{"name":"austindebruyn","email":"austin.debruyn@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.2","_rev":"1-2483c01615699a9ea2c50be5fe11615f","_shasum":"869006a84b0e9762c35fd3f49f272a04b885137f","author":{"name":"austin.xyz"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/austindebruyn/q24/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"2.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"869006a84b0e9762c35fd3f49f272a04b885137f","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/q24/-/q24-2.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"austindebruyn","email":"austin.debruyn@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"readme.md","time":{"modified":"2015-09-13T23:41:51.258Z","created":"2015-03-19T01:48:15.521Z","1.0.0":"2015-03-19T01:48:15.521Z","1.0.1":"2015-03-19T01:54:47.897Z","1.0.2":"2015-03-19T01:56:53.586Z","1.0.3":"2015-03-19T02:06:04.598Z","2.0.0":"2015-09-13T23:39:54.989Z","2.0.1":"2015-09-13T23:41:51.258Z"}}}
