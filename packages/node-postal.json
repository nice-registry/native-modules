Make sure you have the following prerequisites:\n\n**On Ubuntu/Debian**\n```\nsudo apt-get install curl autoconf automake libtool pkg-config\n```\n\n**On CentOS/RHEL**\n```\nsudo yum install curl autoconf automake libtool pkgconfig\n```\n\n**On Mac OSX**\n```\nbrew install curl autoconf automake libtool pkg-config\n```\n\n**Installing libpostal**\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal\ncd libpostal\n./bootstrap.sh\n./configure --datadir=[...some dir with a few GB of space...]\nmake\nsudo make install\n\n# On Linux it's probably a good idea to run\nsudo ldconfig\n```\n**Install node-gyp**\n\nThen install node-gyp system-wide:\n\n```\nsudo npm install -g node-gyp\n```\n\n**Installing node-gyp on Linux (Ubuntu)**\n\nFirst make sure you have:\n\n1. gcc, g++ and make (```sudo apt-get install build-essential``` on Ubuntu)\n2. NodeJS with all the development headers (if using a package manager like apt-get, follow the instructions here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)\n3. python 2.7\n\n\n**Installing the Node bindings**\n\n```\nnpm install openvenues/node-postal\n```\n\nCompatibility\n-------------\n\nnode-postal is tested on most major versions of Node (0.10+) in continuous integration. The C++ bindings are written using [Nan](https://github.com/nodejs/nan), which abstracts the API changes across various versions of V8, so the latest versions of Node will likely work.\n\nIf you're having trouble compiling, post a Github issue with your OS and Node versions along with the output of npm install / node-gyp rebuild.\n\nTests\n-----\n\nTo run the unit tests:\n\n```\nnpm test\n```\n\nTroubleshooting\n---------------\n**Installing [libpostal](https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal):**\nnode-postal is a thin wrapper around libpostal, which is written in C. Installing node-postal with npm will not install libpostal as a dependency. The install steps described above will install it in standard locations for your OS. For OS X and Linux, that's `/usr/local/include` and `/usr/local/lib`. node-postal will look in these locations for the C libraries. If you have problems installing node-postal, check there for recently installed libpostal libraries.\n\n**Downloading Large Files**\nThe ```make``` process downloads ~3GB of data (these are production-quality machine learning models, the kind Google engineers get to use). Make sure the --datadir argument to ```configure```, which requires an absolute path, has enough room to accommodate the models. If you get errors after downloading, e.g.:\n```\nmake[3]: *** [all-local] Error 1\nmake[2]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1\nmake[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1\nmake: *** [all] Error 2\n```\n\nthere may be problems with subsequent install steps. Occasionally something will go wrong and it will give up downloading. Once downloading is complete, the make script will unpack the langauge_classifier.tar.gz.X files. If you see these files, your download may have stopped. Try running the make script again.\n\nSpecial Thanks\n--------------\n\nLucas Hrabovsky (https://github.com/imlucas) for information and examples of repos using Nan, node-gyp, etc.\n","created":"2016-08-04T17:36:43.450Z","modified":"2017-04-06T07:41:42.321Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"albarrentine","email":"pelias@mapzen.com"},"owners":[{"name":"albarrentine","email":"pelias@mapzen.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"node-postal","_nodeVersion":"5.1.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/node-postal-1.0.0.tgz_1491464500456_0.15808478300459683"},"_npmUser":{"name":"albarrentine","email":"pelias@mapzen.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.3.12","_rev":"2-0b7fde8c1262a23df5bd1743cd0a1588","_shasum":"dc4c8bf06cd7a47c9dd65a7dcc323954f943f668","author":{"name":"Al Barrentine","url":"@thatdatabaseguy"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/openvenues/node-postal/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"dc4c8bf06cd7a47c9dd65a7dcc323954f943f668","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/node-postal/-/node-postal-1.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"albarrentine","email":"pelias@mapzen.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-04-06T07:41:42.321Z","created":"2016-08-04T17:36:43.450Z","0.3.0":"2016-08-04T17:36:43.450Z","1.0.0":"2017-04-06T07:41:42.321Z"}}}
