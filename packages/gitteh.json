Installation via NPM:\n\n\tnpm install gitteh\n\n## What?\n\nNode bindings to the excellent [libgit2](http://libgit2.github.com) C library. Right now, the bindings cover read only access to raw objects (trees/commits/blobs/tags/references), and basic access to remotes (including basic cloning/fetching support).\n\nGitteh aims to:\n\n* Be simple and convenient\n* Be as performant as possible - avoids calling into underlying C library as much as possible.\n* Be safe for use in Node's threadpool (read: shouldn't segfault your app)\n\n## Why?\n\nThere's a few libraries out there that wrap git cli commands, parsing the output and such. This is a perfectly acceptable solution. Node-gitteh provides first-class support to work with a git repository on a low level, and does not require git.git (and its myriad of dependencies) to be installed in the server environment.\n\nThe documentation is currently outdated. We're working on a new version currently for the new 0.17.x version of gitteh. The [Old pre-0.17.x documentation can be found here](http://libgit2.github.com/node-gitteh/docs/index.html). Instead, you should visit [`examples`](https://github.com/libgit2/node-gitteh/tree/master/examples) dir in the repo to see examples of 0.17.x usage.\n\n## License\n\nGitteh is available under the MIT License.
