It provides an object based interface to announce and browse services on the local network.\n\n## Synopsis\n\n```js\n// import the module\nvar mdns = require('mdns');\n\n// advertise a http server on port 4321\nvar ad = mdns.createAdvertisement(mdns.tcp('http'), 4321);\nad.start();\n\n// watch all http servers\nvar browser = mdns.createBrowser(mdns.tcp('http'));\nbrowser.on('serviceUp', function(service) {\n  console.log(\"service up: \", service);\n});\nbrowser.on('serviceDown', function(service) {\n  console.log(\"service down: \", service);\n});\nbrowser.start();\n\n// discover all available service types\nvar all_the_types = mdns.browseThemAll(); // all_the_types is just another browser...\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nOn Linux and other systems using the avahi daemon the avahi dns_sd compat library and its header files are required.  On debianesque systems the package name is `libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev`.  On other platforms Apple's [mDNSResponder](http://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/mDNSResponder/) is recommended. Care should be taken not to install more than one mDNS stack on a system.\n\nOn Windows you are going to need Apples \"Bonjour SDK for Windows\". You can download it either from Apple (registration required) or various unofficial sources. Take your pick. After installing the SDK restart your shell or command prompt and make sure the `BONJOUR_SDK_HOME` environment variable is set. You'll also need a compiler. Microsoft Visual Studio Express will do. On Windows node >=0.7.9 is required.\n\nmdns is available as a npm package:\n\n```sh\nnpm install mdns\n```\n\nIf you want to play with the latest source code, here is a more manual approach:\n\n```sh\ngit clone http://github.com/agnat/node_mdns\ncd node_mdns\nnpm link && npm test\n```\n\nIn case you want to run or even publish your package using the development version of mdns you may set the version field to a tarball URL:\n\n```json\n{ \"name\": \"discomvobulator\"\n, \"version\": \"0.0.1\"\n, \"description\": \"covers all your discomvobulation needs\"\n, \"dependencies\":\n  { \"mdns\": \"https://github.com/agnat/node_mdns/tarball/master\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nSee the [user guide](http://agnat.github.com/node_mdns/user_guide.html).\n\n## Contributors\n\nIn random order:\n\n* Orlando Vazquez ([orlandov](https://github.com/orlandov))\n* Ryan Dahl ([ry](https://github.com/ry))\n* Dominic Tarr ([dominictarr](https://github.com/dominictarr))\n* Emil Stenqvist ([emilisto](https://github.com/emilisto))\n* Toby Ealden ([TobyEalden](https://github.com/TobyEalden))\n* Ron Korving ([ronkorving](https://github.com/ronkorving))\n* Don Park ([donpark](https://github.com/donpark))\n* Cong Liu ([ghostoy](https://github.com/ghostoy))\n* Tian Zhang ([KhaosT](https://github.com/KhaosT))\n\nYour name is missing on the list?
