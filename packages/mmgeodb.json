It should be technically possible\nto adapt it for Windows as well.\nThe package includes and builds the libmaxminddb library from source.\nTo to so, it needs the autotools toolchain. More specificly - autoconf,\nlibtool, automake. Also, it needs node-gyp installed:\n    npm install -g node-gyp\n\n## Usage\n\n    var geo = require('mmgeodb');\n    geo.load('path/to/database/file');\n\n    var info = geo.lookupIp('1.2.3.4');\n    console.log(JSON.stringify(info));\n    // {\"ccode\":\"AU\",\"continent\":\"OC\"}\n\n    info = geo.lookupIp('2001:1388:b47:df34:5ddf:cecb:4213:cf37');\n    console.log(JSON.stringify(info));\n    // {\"ccode\":\"PE\",\"continent\":\"SA\"}\n\n\n\nCurrently the returned object contains only two properties:\n\nccode: The 2-letter country code\n<br />\ncontinent: The continent code where the country is located.\n    This is a two-letter code, as follows:\n\n  AF – Africa  \n  AS – Asia  \n  EU – Europe  \n  NA – North America  \n  OC – Oceania  \n  SA – South America  \n\nWhen done with the database, call\n\n    geo.unload()  \nto free memory.\n\n##Notes on libmaxminddb\n\nLibmaxminddb is built by this package as a static lib, and linked into\nthe node module shared object (.node file). This means that you can't\nupdate the version used without rebuilding the module.\n\nThe version of libmaxminddb, included with this package has a\nslightly modified build system. It doesn't build the 't' subdirectory,\ncontaining tests, because it has a dependency on libtap. Also, it adds\nthe -fPIC flag (in common.mk) because the generated code, even though\nof a static lib, is later linked into a shared object, so the code must\nbe position-independent.\n\t\n","versions":[{"number":"0.1.0","date":"2014-09-25T22:42:22.037Z"},{"number":"0.1.1","date":"2014-09-25T22:54:20.413Z"},{"number":"0.1.2","date":"2014-09-25T23:07:02.522Z"},{"number":"0.1.3","date":"2014-09-26T09:46:29.121Z"},{"number":"0.1.4","date":"2014-09-26T09:46:50.554Z"},{"number":"0.1.6","date":"2014-09-26T10:04:45.574Z"},{"number":"0.1.9","date":"2014-09-26T10:12:06.719Z"},{"number":"0.1.10","date":"2014-09-26T10:26:18.033Z"},{"number":"0.1.11","date":"2014-10-18T12:40:07.437Z"},{"number":"0.1.13","date":"2014-10-18T16:14:42.881Z"},{"number":"0.1.14","date":"2015-01-19T07:11:30.940Z"},{"number":"0.1.24","date":"2015-01-19T07:34:56.379Z"},{"number":"0.1.25","date":"2015-01-25T13:40:32.359Z"},{"number":"0.1.26","date":"2015-01-25T13:55:31.432Z"},{"number":"0.1.27","date":"2015-01-26T19:24:43.539Z"}],"starsCount":0,"created":"2014-09-25T22:42:08.656Z","modified":"2015-01-26T19:24:43.539Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"avasilev","email":"avasilev@gmx.net"},"owners":[{"name":"avasilev","email":"avasilev@gmx.net"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"mmgeodb","_npmUser":{"name":"avasilev","email":"avasilev@gmx.net"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.28","_rev":"1-b144ebd964847719336964d7cad5d6fa","_shasum":"6748892ca33c28ae84773bfbcd2ca310d4a55700","author":{"name":"Alexander Vassilev"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.27"},"dist":{"shasum":"6748892ca33c28ae84773bfbcd2ca310d4a55700","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/mmgeodb/-/mmgeodb-0.1.27.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"avasilev","email":"avasilev@gmx.net"}],"readmeFilename":"Readme.md","time":{"modified":"2015-01-26T19:24:43.539Z","created":"2014-09-25T22:42:08.656Z","0.1.0":"2014-09-25T22:42:22.037Z","0.1.1":"2014-09-25T22:54:20.413Z","0.1.2":"2014-09-25T23:07:02.522Z","0.1.3":"2014-09-26T09:46:29.121Z","0.1.4":"2014-09-26T09:46:50.554Z","0.1.6":"2014-09-26T10:04:45.574Z","0.1.9":"2014-09-26T10:12:06.719Z","0.1.10":"2014-09-26T10:26:18.033Z","0.1.11":"2014-10-18T12:40:07.437Z","0.1.13":"2014-10-18T16:14:42.881Z","0.1.14":"2015-01-19T07:11:30.940Z","0.1.24":"2015-01-19T07:34:56.379Z","0.1.25":"2015-01-25T13:40:32.359Z","0.1.26":"2015-01-25T13:55:31.432Z","0.1.27":"2015-01-26T19:24:43.539Z"},"users":{}}}
