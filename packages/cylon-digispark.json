The hub on a Cinema display will work as well.\n\nDO NOT plug in the Digispark to your computer's USB port until prompted.\n\nInstall the cylon-digispark module:\n\n    $ npm install cylon-digispark\n\n\nAfter installing the cylon-digispark npm module run the following command to upload littlewire to the digispark, plug it to a USB port when prompted:\n\n    $ gort digispark upload\n\nOnce plugged in, use the `cylon scan usb` command to verify your connection info:\n\n    $ gort scan usb\n\nNow use the `ID` info returned to find the `product` and `vendor` ID's required to establish a connection with the Digispark in your Cylon code.\n\nThat is it, you are set to start running Cylon digispark examples.\n\n### Ubuntu\n\nDO NOT plug in the Digispark to your computer's USB port until prompted.\n\nInstall the cylon-digispark npm module:\n\n    $ npm install cylon-digispark\n\nAfter installing the cylon-digispark module run the following command to upload littlewire to the digispark, plug it to a USB port when prompted. You might be asked to enter your sudo password, since uploading littlewire to the digispark requires some new udev rules, you can check and review them in /etc/udev/rules.d/49-micronucleus.rules after running the `gort digispark set-udev-rules` command:\n\n    $ gort digispark upload\n\nOnce plugged in, use the `cylon scan usb` command to verify your connection info:\n\n    $ gort scan usb\n\nNow use the `ID` info returned to find the `product` and `vendor` ID's required to establish a connection with the Digispark in your cylon code.\n\nThat is it, you are set to start running Cylon digispark examples.\n\nThanks to [@bluebie](https://github.com/Bluebie) for the help with udev rules used when uploading littlewire to the digispark!
