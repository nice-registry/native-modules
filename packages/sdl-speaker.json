Especially for realtime audio stream. \n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/sdl-speaker.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sdl-speaker)\n\n## Installing / Getting started\n\nYou need SDL2 in your system. \n\n- Mac: `brew install sdl2`. \n- Windows: Download SDL2 from [www.libsdl.org](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php).\n\n```shell\n$ npm install sdl-speaker\n```\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\nconst Speaker = require('sdl-speaker');\nconst defaultFormat = {\n  channels: 1,\n  sampleRate: 16000,\n  samplesPerFrame: 320,\n};\n\n// Init SDL Speaker.\nSpeaker.init(defaultFormat);\n\n// Register a channel for write buf.\nlet test = Speaker.register('test');\n\n// write some buffer;\ntest.write(buf);\n\n// When you are ready..\n// Start play audio\nSpeaker.start();\n```\n\n## Api Reference\n\n## Speaker.init([ option ])\n\nInit SDL. `option` is optional.\n\n- `channels`: Channel count. default: `1`.\n- `samplesRate`: Sample rate for every channel. default: `16000`.\n- `samplesPerFrame`: Samples per frame. default: `320`.\n\n### Speaker.start()\n\nStart play audio. Read audio data from a ring buffer. If data in ring buffer less than `samplesPerFrame`, fill 0.\n\n### Speaker.stop()\n\nClose and Destroy SDL player.\n\n### Speaker.pause()\n\nPause SDL player.\n\n### Speaker.resume()\n\nResume SDL player.\n\n### Speaker.detach(name)\n\nDetach audio source from SDL.\n\n### Speaker.cleanAll()\n\nClean all audio sources's buffer.\n\n#### Speaker.register(name) -> audioSource\n\nRegister a audio source for write buffer. The `name` must unique.\n\n#### audioSource.write(buffer)\n\nWrite audio buffer to ring buffer. You can write before speaker start.\n\n#### audioSource.clean()\n\nClean this audio source's buffer.\n\n## TODO\n\n- [ ] More Test.\n- [ ] Fix Travis-CI build failed.\n- [ ] Pipe stream to `audioSource`.\n- [ ] Customise `rbuf` capability.\n- [ ] Self contained `SDL2`.\n","created":"2017-06-09T07:44:33.138Z","modified":"2017-08-11T03:17:50.019Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"0nese7en","email":"siyuan.se7en@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"0nese7en","email":"siyuan.se7en@gmail.com"},{"name":"sharpbai","email":"sharpbai@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"sdl-speaker","_nodeVersion":"8.1.3","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/sdl-speaker-0.3.9.tgz_1502421469779_0.6208133336622268"},"_npmUser":{"name":"0nese7en","email":"siyuan.se7en@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"5.0.3","_rev":"15-81991956a543b8c419f114a9cd537f13","author":{"name":"0nese7en","email":"siyuan.se7en@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/duobeiyun/node-sdl-speaker/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"sharpbai","email":"sharpbai@gmail.com"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.3.9"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-o4vix5JuGNy+z1in5Pt2gq/Lam52WbgqaX/fxcbm8v5lY5KkUFPcs5t9AHeu3NWVBoTFgI3sTs7iXpYRcDWi0g==","shasum":"8764850dbfead75fc06cbca77dd4afce85707327","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/sdl-speaker/-/sdl-speaker-0.3.9.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"0nese7en","email":"siyuan.se7en@gmail.com"},{"name":"sharpbai","email":"sharpbai@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-08-11T03:17:50.019Z","created":"2017-06-09T07:44:33.138Z","0.1.0":"2017-06-09T07:44:33.138Z","0.1.1":"2017-06-09T09:21:16.096Z","0.1.2":"2017-06-12T09:43:04.244Z","0.2.0":"2017-06-26T14:55:38.302Z","0.3.0":"2017-07-07T05:35:25.838Z","0.3.1":"2017-07-07T06:15:58.227Z","0.3.2":"2017-07-10T09:07:59.030Z","0.3.3":"2017-07-11T02:38:33.677Z","0.3.4":"2017-07-12T07:40:03.096Z","0.3.5":"2017-07-13T08:55:28.226Z","0.3.6":"2017-07-13T09:03:13.864Z","0.3.7":"2017-07-19T09:09:03.724Z","0.3.8":"2017-08-10T09:30:37.050Z","0.3.9":"2017-08-11T03:17:50.019Z"}}}
