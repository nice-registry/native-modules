`resizeImage(source, options, callback)` - resize image using ImageMagick\n   - source can be a Buffer or file name\n   - options can have the following properties:\n     - width - output image width, if negative and the original image width is smaller than the specified, nothing happens\n     - height - output image height, if negative and the original image height is smaller this the specified, nothing happens\n     - quality - 0 - 99\n     - out - output file name\n     - ext - image extention\n     - outfile - a filename where to save scaled image, if not given the binary image data is passed to the callback\n     - frame - which frame to resize for animated GIFs, 0 is default, -1 to convert all frames\n     - no_animation - if set to 1 it will convert GIF animation, otherwise animated GIF is simply returned as is\n     - posterize - levels, 2,3,4\n     - dither - 1 to dither\n     - normalize - 1 to normalize image\n     - quantize - number of colors\n     - treedepth - 0 or 1 for quantize\n     - flip - 1 to flip image\n     - flop - 1 1 to flop image\n     - blur_radius - radius in pixels\n     - blur_sigma - std deviation in pixels\n     - sharpen_radius - radius in pixels\n     - sharpen_sigma - std deviation in pixels\n     - brightness - -100 - 100\n     - contrast - -100 - 100\n     - rotate - degrees\n     - opacity - 0 - 1.0\n     - crop_width - crop coordinates\n     - crop_height\n     - crop_x\n     - crop_y\n     - bgcolor - RGB for background\n     - filter - box, triangle, hermite, hanning, hamming, blackman, gaussian,\n                quadratic, cubic, catrom, mitchell, lanczos, kaiser, welsh, parzen,\n                bohman, barlett, lagrange, jinc, sinc, sincfast, lanczossharp, lanzos2,\n                lanzos2sharp, robidoux, robidouxsharp, cosine, spline, lanczosradius\n     - colorspace - rgb, gray, transparent, ohta, xyz, ycbcr, ycc, yiq, ypbpr, yuv,\n                    cmylk, srgb, hls, hwb\n     - gravity - northwest, north, northeast, west, center, east, southwest, south, southeast\n\n  On return the callback will receive the image data if no outfile was specified or null, and the third\n  argument if an object with the result image information: file, ext, height, width, orientation, rotation. \n\n  The original image dimentions are returned as _width and _height.\n\n  The file where the image is sved will have the actual extention, if the outfile parameter contains invalid extention\n  it will be replaced with the actual resulting image type.\n\n```javascript\n  require(\"bkjs-wand\").resizeImage(\"a.png\", { width: 120, height: 120 }, function(err, data, info) {\n     if (!err) fs.writeFile(\"b.png\", data);\n     console.log(err, info);\n  })\n```\n\n# Author\n\nVlad Seryakov\n\n","created":"2015-10-15T03:45:19.206Z","modified":"2017-06-09T16:40:51.448Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"veryakov","email":"vseryakov@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"veryakov","email":"vseryakov@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"bkjs-wand","_nodeVersion":"6.11.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/bkjs-wand-0.5.0.tgz_1497026450467_0.0791857282165438"},"_npmUser":{"name":"veryakov","email":"vseryakov@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.10","_rev":"12-c4feaa71efd7e3c522619c37957d90ad","_shasum":"13e284dd403bc4c9f8559d4ff2dca08dfc252af9","author":{"name":"Vlad Seryakov"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/vseryakov/bkjs-wand/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.5.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"13e284dd403bc4c9f8559d4ff2dca08dfc252af9","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/bkjs-wand/-/bkjs-wand-0.5.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"veryakov","email":"vseryakov@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-06-09T16:40:51.448Z","created":"2015-10-15T03:45:19.206Z","0.1.0":"2015-10-15T03:45:19.206Z","0.1.1":"2015-10-16T15:57:44.311Z","0.1.2":"2016-03-09T19:14:54.928Z","0.2.0":"2016-05-07T01:51:34.204Z","0.2.2":"2016-08-09T04:43:29.486Z","0.3.0":"2016-10-05T21:34:52.323Z","0.3.2":"2016-11-01T05:03:23.861Z","0.3.3":"2016-11-03T20:48:38.191Z","0.4.1":"2017-01-03T01:10:48.823Z","0.4.2":"2017-03-04T00:01:47.490Z","0.4.3":"2017-03-04T04:23:38.907Z","0.4.4":"2017-05-19T01:15:02.654Z","0.4.5":"2017-05-21T04:48:27.594Z","0.4.6":"2017-06-05T23:19:58.451Z","0.4.7":"2017-06-06T22:20:53.212Z","0.4.8":"2017-06-09T03:45:18.294Z","0.5.0":"2017-06-09T16:40:51.448Z"}}}
