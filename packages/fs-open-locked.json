After a file has been opened locked\nany subsequent opens will fail until the file is closed. Note that files automatically close when you exit a process.\n\n``` js\nvar open = require('fs-open-locked')\n\nopen('my-lock-file', 'w', function (err, fd) {\n  console.log('got fd?', err, fd) // should succeed\n  open('my-lock-file', 'w', function (err, fd) {\n    console.log('got fd again?', err, fd) // will fail cause the file is locked\n  })\n})\n```\n\n## API\n\n#### `open(filename, flags, [mode], callback)`\n\nSimilar to [fs.open](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/fs.html#fs_fs_open_path_flags_mode_callback) except will fail if another process has already opened this file.\nCallback is called with `(err, fd)` where `fd` is a file descriptor.\nWhen the descriptor is closed another process is free to open the file.\n\n#### `var fd = open.sync(filename, flags, [mode])`\n\nSync version of above.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n","created":"2017-04-17T19:44:10.621Z","modified":"2017-04-17T19:44:10.621Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"mafintosh","email":"mathiasbuus@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"mafintosh","email":"mathiasbuus@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"fs-open-locked","_nodeVersion":"6.9.5","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/fs-open-locked-0.0.0.tgz_1492458250034_0.9870379748754203"},"_npmUser":{"name":"mafintosh","email":"mathiasbuus@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.10","_rev":"1-09bf7ea440c5e28ee8042dda12bf92d6","_shasum":"330ca7507664d1619e999be02a4ae877b6d719d3","author":{"name":"Mathias Buus","url":"@mafintosh"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mafintosh/fs-open-locked/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"330ca7507664d1619e999be02a4ae877b6d719d3","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/fs-open-locked/-/fs-open-locked-0.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"mafintosh","email":"mathiasbuus@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-04-17T19:44:10.621Z","created":"2017-04-17T19:44:10.621Z","0.0.0":"2017-04-17T19:44:10.621Z"}}}
