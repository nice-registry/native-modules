LevelUP is optimised for usability and safety. Although we are working to improve the safety of the `rocksdb` interface it is still easy to crash your Node process if you don't do things in just the right way.\n\n<a name=\"platforms\"></a>\nTested & supported platforms\n----------------------------\n\n  * **Linux** (including ARM platforms such as Raspberry Pi *and Kindle!*)\n  * **Mac OS**\n  * **Solaris** (SmartOS & Nodejitsu)\n  * **FreeBSD**\n  * **Windows**\n    * See installation instructions for *node-gyp* dependencies [here](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp#installation), you'll need these (free) components from Microsoft to compile and run any native Node add-on in Windows.\n\n<a name=\"api\"></a>\n## API\n\n`rocksdb` implements the same API of [LevelDown](https://github.com/level/leveldown#api).\n\n<a name=\"support\"></a>\nGetting support\n---------------\n\nThere are multiple ways you can find help in using LevelDB in Node.js:\n\n * **IRC:** you'll find an active group of LevelUP users in the **##leveldb** channel on Freenode, including most of the contributors to this project.\n * **Mailing list:** there is an active [Node.js LevelDB](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/node-levelup) Google Group.\n * **GitHub:** you're welcome to open an issue here on this GitHub repository if you have a question.\n\n<a name=\"contributing\"></a>\nContributing\n------------\n\nrocksdb is an **OPEN Open Source Project**. This means that:\n\n> Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.\n\nSee the [contribution guide](https://github.com/Level/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.\n\n### Windows\n\nA large portion of the Windows support comes from code by [Krzysztof Kowalczyk](http://blog.kowalczyk.info/) [@kjk](https://twitter.com/kjk), see his Windows LevelDB port [here](http://code.google.com/r/kkowalczyk-leveldb/). If you're using LevelUP on Windows, you should give him your thanks!\n\nPrebuilt binaries\n-----------------\n\n`rocksdb` uses `prebuild` and `prebuild-install` for handling prebuilt binaries. See [this list](https://github.com/Level/rocksdb/releases) of supported prebuilt platform binaries. When installing rocksdb `prebuild-install` will install prebuilt binaries from GitHub if they exist and fallback to a compile step if they don't.\n\nIf you are working on `rocksdb` and want to re-compile the C++ code it's enough to do `npm install`.\n\nIf you don't want to use the `prebuild` for the platform you are installing on, specify the `--build-from-source` flag when you install.\n\n<a name=\"license\"></a>\nLicense &amp; copyright\n-------------------\n\nCopyright &copy; 2012-2017 **LevelDown** [contributors](https://github.com/level/community#contributors).\n\n**rocksdb** is licensed under the MIT license.
