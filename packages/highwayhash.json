highwayhash\n\nNode.js implementation of Google's [HighwayHash](https://github.com/google/highwayhash).\n\nBased on [SipHash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SipHash),\nit is believed to be robust against hash flooding and timing attacks\nbecause memory accesses are sequential and the algorithm is branch-free.\n\nThis makes it suitable for random number generators and hash tables storing untrusted data.\n\nAVX2 or SSE4.1 instruction sets will be used when available at runtime.\n\nExpect up to 8 million operations/second,\ndepending on the length of the input and the output type required.\n\nAs JavaScript lacks native support for 64-bit integers,\nhash values are made available as hex, string, Buffer and\nlow/high 32-bit unsigned integer types.\n\nIf the input to be hashed is trusted,\na cryptographically-insecure alternative is\n[FarmHash](https://github.com/lovell/farmhash).\n\n## Requirements\n\n* x64 CPU (ARM support coming soon)\n* Node.js v4+\n* [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) and its dependencies\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install highwayhash\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nconst highwayhash = require('highwayhash');\n```\n\n```javascript\nconst key = require('crypto').randomBytes(32);\n\nconst input = Buffer.from('The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy sleeping dog');\n\nconst hashAsString = highwayhash.asString(key, input);\n// Example: '15456351453344120596'\n\nconst hashAsHexString = highwayhash.asHexString(key, input);\n// Example: '143f2b6cc1fd7fd6'\n\nconst hashAsUInt32Low = highwayhash.asUInt32Low(key, input);\n// Example: 1814773524\n\nconst hashAsUInt32High = highwayhash.asUInt32High(key, input);\n// Example: 3598712257\n\nconst hashAsBuffer = highwayhash.asBuffer(key, input);\n// Example: <Buffer 14 3f 2b 6c c1 fd 7f d6>\n\n```\n\n## API\n\n* `key` is a Buffer containing 32 bytes (256-bit)\n* `input` is a Buffer to calculate a hash value of\n\n### asString(key, input)\n\nReturns a String representing the 64-bit unsigned integer hash value of `input`.\n\n### asHexString(key, input)\n\nReturns a hexadecimal String representing the 64-bit unsigned integer hash value of `input`.\nThis is equivalent to but much faster than `asBuffer().toString('hex')`.\n\n### asBuffer(key, input)\n\nReturns a Buffer representing the 64-bit unsigned integer hash value of `input`.\n\nThis method is much slower then `asString` so only use this method when the hash value needs to be in a Buffer.\n\n### asUInt32Low(key, input)\n\nReturns a Number representing the low 32-bits of the 64-bit unsigned integer hash value of `input`.\n\n### asUInt32High(key, input)\n\nReturns a Number representing the high 32-bits of the 64-bit unsigned integer hash value of `input`.\n\n## Benchmarks\n\n* [Intel i3-4170](http://ark.intel.com/products/77490/Intel-Core-i3-4170-Processor-3M-Cache-3_70-GHz)\n* Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS\n* Node.js v6.9.4\n* Cryptographically strong pseudo-random input via OpenSSL's RAND_bytes\n\n| Input size / bytes | Hash function  | Hash size / bits | Output data type  | Ops/sec   |\n| -----------------: |
