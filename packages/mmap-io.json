So out of need I threw this together along with the functionality I found was missing in the node-mmap: advice and sync.\n\nStrong temptations to re-order arguments to something more sane was kept at bay, and I kept it as mmap(2) and node-mmap for compatibility. Notable difference is the additional optional argument to pass a usage advise in the mapping stage. I've given advise and sync more practical arguments, out of an io.js perspective, than their C/C++ counterparts.\n\nThe flag constants have the same crooked names as in C/C++ to make it straight forward for the user to google the net and relate to man-pages.\n\nThis is my first io.js addon and after hours wasted reading up on V8 API I luckily stumbled upon [Native Abstractions for Node](https://github.com/rvagg/nan). Makes life so much easier. Hot tip!\n\n_mmap-io_ is written in C++11 and [LiveScript](https://github.com/gkz/LiveScript).\n\nIt should be noted that mem-mapping is by nature potentially blocking, and _should not be used in concurrent serving/processing applications_, but rather has it's niche where multiple processes are working on the same giant sets of data (thereby sparing physical memory, and load times if the kernel does it's job for read ahead), preferably multiple readers and single or none concurrent writer, to not spoil the gains by shitloads of mutexes. And your noble specific use case ofcourse.\n\n\n# News and Updates\n\n### 2017-03-08: version 0.11.1\n- compilation fixes 10.8 OSX fix. Thanks to @arrayjam\n\n### 2016-07-21: version 0.10.1\n- incore fix for Mac OS. Thanks @rustyconover\n\n### 2016-07-14: version 0.10.0\n- incore added. Thanks to @rustyconover\n\n### 2015-10-10: version 0.9.4\n- Compilation on Mac should work now. Thanks to @aeickhoff\n\n### 2015-10-01: version 0.9.3\n- Windows compatibility added. Thanks to @toxicwolf\n- Rewrote the bindings to Nan 2.0.9 API version (V8/io/Node hell...)\n    + Had to remove the error _codes_ to get it working in the time I had\n      available (or rather - didn't have..) -\n      error messages are still there - with code in message instead. Though,\n      usually nothing goes wrong, so only the test cares ;-)\n- Added some helpful targets in Makefile `human_errors`, `ls` only, `build`\n  only, etc. (useful if you wanna hack the module)\n- Since all _functionality_ that can possibly be is in place, I bumped all the\n  way to 0.8. Not battle tested enough to warrant higher.\n- Commented away experimental async read-ahead caching when readahead hint was on. It\n  hasn't broken, but it's an unnecessary risk. Plays safe. You can toy with it\n  yourself if you want to try to milk out some _ms_ performance.\n\n### 2015-03-04: version 0.1.3\n- This is the first public commit, and the code has one day of development put into it as of now. More tests are needed so don't count on it being production ready just yet (but soon).\n\n\n# Install\n```\nnpm install mmap-io\n```\n\nor as git clone:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/ozra/mmap-io.git\ncd mmap-io\nmake\n```\n\nFor dev'ing, there are some shell-scripts for just building individual parts, the Makefile is more of convenience and does the whole hoola baloo including configuring.\n\n\n\n# Usage\n\n**Note: All code in examples are in LiveScript**\n\n```livescript\n\n# Following code is plastic fruit; not t[ae]sted...\n\nmmap = require \"mmap-io\"\nfs = require \"fs\"\n\nsome-file = \"./foo.bar\"\n\nfd = fs.open-sync some-file, \"r\"\nfd-w = fs.open-sync some-file, \"r+\"\n\n# In the following comments, `[blah]` denotes optional argument,\n# `foo = x` denotes default values for arguments\n\n# map( size, protection, privacy, fd [, offset = 0 [, advise = 0]] ) -> Buffer\n\nsize = fs.stat-sync(fd).size\nrx-prot = mmap.PROT_READ .|. mmap.PROT_EXECUTE\npriv = mmap.MAP_SHARED\n\nbuffer = mmap.map size, rx-prot, priv, fd\nbuffer2 = mmap.map size, mmap.PROT_READ, priv, fd, 0, mmap.MADV_SEQUENTIAL\nw-buffer = mmap.map size, mmap.PROT_WRITE, priv, fd-w\n\n# advise( buffer, advise ) -> void\n# advise( buffer, offset, length, advise ) -> void\n\nmmap.advise w-buffer, mmap.MADV_RANDOM\n\n# sync( buffer ) -> void\n# sync( buffer, offset, length ) -> void\n# sync( buffer, is-blocking-sync[, do-page-invalidation = false] ) -> void\n# sync( buffer, offset = 0, length = buffer.length [, is-blocking-sync = false [, do-page-invalidation = false]] ) -> void\n\nw-buffer[47] = 42\nmmap.sync w-buffer\nmmap.sync w-buffer, true\nmmap.sync w-buffer, 0, size\nmmap.sync w-buffer, 0, size, true\nmmap.sync w-buffer, 0, size, true, false\n\n# incore( buffer ) -> [ pages_unmapped, pages_mapped ]\n\ncore_stats = mmap.incore(buffer)\npages_mapped = core_stats[1]\n\n# Yeah, you will do _one_ of the variants ofcourse..\n\n```\n\n### Good to Know (TM)\n\n- Checkout man pages mmap(2), madvise(2), msync(2), mincore(2) for more detailed intell.\n- The mappings is automatically unmapped when the buffer is garbage collected.\n- Write-mappings need the fd to be opened with \"r+\", or you'll get a permission error (13).\n- If you make a read-only mapping and then ignorantly set a value in the buffer, all hell previously unknown to a JS'er breaks loose (segmentation fault). It is possible to write some devilous code to intercept the SIGSEGV and throw an exception, but let's not do that!\n- `Offset`, and in some cases `length` needs to be a multiple of mmap-io.PAGESIZE (which commonly is 4096)\n\n\n# Tests\n```\nnode ./test.js\n```\n\n\n# Todo, Not Todo and Stuff\n- More tests\n- Huge pages are only supported for anonymous / private mappings (well, in Linux), so I didn't throw in flags for that since I found no use.\n- As Ben Noordhuis previously has stated: Supplying hint for a fixed virtual memory adress is kinda moot point in JS, so not supported.\n- If you miss a feature - contribute! Or request it in an issue. I might add it. I intend to maintain this module since it will be part of a great deal of code I'm working on.\n- If documentation isn't clear, make an issue.\n\n# Contributions\nPlease PR to 'develop' branch.\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2015-03-05T00:08:25.544Z","modified":"2017-03-08T02:00:01.460Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"ozra","email":"oscar@campbell.nu"},"owners":[{"name":"ozra","email":"oscar@campbell.nu"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"mmap-io","_nodeVersion":"6.9.5","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/mmap-io-0.11.1.tgz_1488938400733_0.6445840196684003"},"_npmUser":{"name":"ozra","email":"oscar@campbell.nu"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.10","_rev":"2-4391176845ef59509fc2570bab6eb4f2","_shasum":"511d2f17e5a05ee73cf5e9bc46d5906af190b60e","author":{"name":"Oscar Campbell","email":"oscar@campbell.nu","url":"https://github.com/ozra"},"bugs":{"url":"http://github.com/ozra/mmap-io/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.11.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"511d2f17e5a05ee73cf5e9bc46d5906af190b60e","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/mmap-io/-/mmap-io-0.11.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"ozra","email":"oscar@campbell.nu"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-03-08T02:00:01.460Z","created":"2015-03-05T00:08:25.544Z","0.1.0":"2015-03-05T00:08:25.544Z","0.1.1":"2015-03-05T00:53:35.364Z","0.1.3":"2015-03-05T17:42:22.332Z","0.1.4":"2015-03-05T20:12:29.577Z","0.1.6":"2015-03-05T22:45:42.589Z","0.9.1":"2015-04-14T18:46:16.660Z","0.8.1":"2015-10-01T20:44:53.333Z","0.9.3":"2015-10-01T20:48:30.259Z","0.9.4":"2015-10-10T20:50:59.509Z","0.10.0":"2016-07-14T10:05:24.741Z","0.10.1":"2016-07-21T21:56:20.530Z","0.11.1":"2017-03-08T02:00:01.460Z"},"users":{"horpto":true}}}
