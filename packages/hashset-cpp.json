Instead consider using `hash_set` which is a more generic implementation with templates.\nThis is only useful for very specific use cases having specific memory layout requirements.\n\n## Setup\n\n```\nnpm install --save hashset-cpp\n```\n\n## Sample\n\n```c++\n#include <iostream>\n#include \"hash_set.h\"\n#include \"test/example_data.h\"\n\nusing std::cout;\nusing std::endl;\n\nint main(int argc, char **argv) {\n  // Bucket size is 256 and don't allow multiple items per item hash.\n  HashSet<ExampleData> set(256, false);\n  set.Add(ExampleData(\"test\"));\n\n  // Prints true\n  cout << \"test exists: \" << (set.Exists(ExampleData(\"test\"))\n      ? \"true\" : \"false\") << endl;\n  // Prints false\n  cout << \"test2 exists: \" << (set.Exists(ExampleData(\"test2\"))\n      ? \"true\" : \"false\") << endl;\n\n  uint32_t len;\n  char * buffer = set.Serialize(&len);\n  HashSet<ExampleData> set2(0, false);\n  set2.Deserialize(buffer, len);\n  // Prints true\n  cout << \"test exists: \" << (set2.Exists(ExampleData(\"test\"))\n      ? \"true\" : \"false\") << endl;\n  // Prints false\n  cout << \"test2 exists: \" << (set2.Exists(ExampleData(\"test2\"))\n      ? \"true\" : \"false\") << endl;\n\n  delete[] buffer;\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Build everything in release\n\n```\nmake\n```\n\n## Running sample\n\n```\nmake sample\n```\n\n## Running tests\n\n```\nmake test\n```\n\n## Clearing build files\n```\nmake clean\n```\n\n## Linting\n```\nnpm run lint\n```\n","created":"2015-11-10T02:40:50.126Z","modified":"2017-06-28T15:41:19.068Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"brianbondy","email":"netzen@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"brianbondy","email":"netzen@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"hashset-cpp","_nodeVersion":"8.1.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/hashset-cpp-2.0.0.tgz_1498664478814_0.30171529948711395"},"_npmUser":{"name":"brianbondy","email":"netzen@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"5.0.3","_rev":"2-ee0646a2e32e93c4b930f907b6ebfb9b","author":{"name":"Brian R.
