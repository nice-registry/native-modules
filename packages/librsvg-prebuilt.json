The formats include:\n\n *  PNG\n *  PDF\n *  SVG\n *  Raw memory buffer image\n\nThis repository is fork of https://github.com/2gis/node-rsvg with prebuilt binaries. It will be rebased on a regular basis.\nAfter spending days on getting the compilation to work under windows, i decided to publish prebuilt binaries of this project.\n\nCurrently available binary releases are:\n\n| Node ABI Version | win32(ia32) | win32(x64) | darwin(ia32) | darwin(x64) | linux(ia32) | linux(x64) |\n|:----------------:|:-----------:|:----------:|:------------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:----------:|\n|51                |:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:x:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|\n|48                |:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:x:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|\n|47                |:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:x:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|\n|46                |:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:x:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|\n|43                |:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:x:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|\n|42                |:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:x:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|\n|14                |:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:x:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|\n|11                |:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:x:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|\n|electron-v1.4.*   |:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:x:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|\n|electron-v1.3.*   |:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:x:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|\n|electron-v1.2.*   |:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:x:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|\n|electron-v1.0.*   |:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:x:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|\n\n## Contributing\n\nYou have a cool idea/feature/pull request? Great! But please head over to https://github.com/2gis/node-rsvg since all changes should be made there.\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nHere is a simple example. Look in `index.js` for more documentation.\n\n```javascript\nvar Rsvg = require('librsvg-prebuilt').Rsvg;\nvar fs = require('fs');\n\n// Create SVG render instance.\nvar svg = new Rsvg();\n\n// When finishing reading SVG, render and save as PNG image.\nsvg.on('finish', function() {\n  console.log('SVG width: ' + svg.width);\n  console.log('SVG height: ' + svg.height);\n  fs.writeFile('tiger.png', svg.render({\n    format: 'png',\n    width: 600,\n    height: 400\n  }).data);\n});\n\n// Stream SVG file into render instance.\nfs.createReadStream('tiger.svg').pipe(svg);\n```\n\n## Possible breaking changes\n\nBefore v0.6.0 in case of error `getBaseURI` returned `null`.\nSince v0.6.0 possibly breaking change was introduced: now `getBaseURI` method always returns string. In case of error an empty string is returned, so it might affect user code that relies on strict equality to `null`. \n\n## Installation\n\nIf you are not using windows, you nees to install the librsvg library first. You can find instructions for different operating systems below. After that, you simply run:\n\n```bash\nnpm install librsvg-prebuilt\n```\n\nLibrary versions known to work:\n\n *  LibRSVG 2.26+\n *  Cairo 1.8.8+\n\n#### Ubuntu:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install librsvg2-bin\n```\n\n#### RedHat / OpenSUSE:\n\n```bash\nsudo yum install librsvg2-bin\n```\n\n#### Mac OS X:\n\n```bash\nbrew install librsvg\n```\n\nIf, after installing LibRSVG through homebrew you are experiencing issues installing this module, try manually exporting the package config with this command:\n\n```bash\nexport PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig\n```\n\nThen try reinstalling this module. For further information, [see this thread](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/14123).\n\n#### Windows:\n\nAll nessecary files are bundled in the binary (yes, even the vc runtime)\n","versions":[{"number":"0.7.0","date":"2017-01-04T19:37:46.987Z"},{"number":"0.7.1","date":"2017-01-05T11:36:20.068Z"},{"number":"0.7.2","date":"2017-01-05T11:43:27.221Z"},{"number":"0.7.3","date":"2017-01-05T14:10:26.005Z"},{"number":"0.7.4","date":"2017-01-09T11:13:49.963Z"},{"number":"0.7.5","date":"2017-01-10T13:42:55.325Z"}],"starsCount":1,"created":"2017-01-04T19:37:46.987Z","modified":"2017-01-10T13:42:55.325Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"f3lang","email":"wf@felbermeier.com"},"owners":[{"name":"f3lang","email":"wf@felbermeier.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"librsvg-prebuilt","_nodeVersion":"6.9.2","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/librsvg-prebuilt-0.7.5.tgz_1484055774666_0.04258218873292208"},"_npmUser":{"name":"f3lang","email":"wf@felbermeier.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.9","_rev":"8-5df2dee3f79bc770a9018ef158dfd29e","_shasum":"f5bbe83e0198bbfc3bef8b1c4b856a0c5ebc078a","author":{"name":"Wolfgang Felbermeier","email":"wf@felbermeier.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/f3lang/node-rsvg-prebuilt/issues","email":"wf@felbermeier.com"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.7.5"},"dist":{"shasum":"f5bbe83e0198bbfc3bef8b1c4b856a0c5ebc078a","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/librsvg-prebuilt/-/librsvg-prebuilt-0.7.5.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"f3lang","email":"wf@felbermeier.com"}],"readmeFilename":"readme.md","time":{"modified":"2017-01-10T13:42:55.325Z","created":"2017-01-04T19:37:46.987Z","0.7.0":"2017-01-04T19:37:46.987Z","0.7.1":"2017-01-05T11:36:20.068Z","0.7.2":"2017-01-05T11:43:27.221Z","0.7.3":"2017-01-05T14:10:26.005Z","0.7.4":"2017-01-09T11:13:49.963Z","0.7.5":"2017-01-10T13:42:55.325Z"},"users":{"f3lang":true}}}
