These node-osmium\nbindings, due to the expense of passing objects from C++ to Javascript, are\nmuch slower than working in C++ directly. Consider `node-osmium` only for small\nextracts and prototyping. For large extracts or planet processing we recommend\nleveraging the [libosmium C++ API](http://docs.osmcode.org/libosmium-manual/)\ninstead of using node-osmium.\n\n\n## Is node-osmium actively developed?\n\n@springmeyer and @joto are maintaining node-osmium but not actively adding\nfeatures. We will consider pull requests adding features only when they come\nwith very solid tests, add very clear value to the bindings, and seem easy to\nmaintain.\n\n\n## Depends\n\n - Node.js v0.10.x, v4.x, v5.x, v6.x\n   (v4 and later supported only with node-osmium >= 0.5.x)\n - Mocha (http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/, for tests)\n - Compiler that supports `-std=c++11` (>= clang++ 3.6 || >= g++ 4.8)\n - [libosmium](https://github.com/osmcode/libosmium) >= 2.10.3\n   (Debian/Ubuntu: libosmium2-dev)\n - [protozero](https://github.com/mapbox/protozero) >= 1.4.5\n   This is included in the libosmium repository and might or might not\n   have been installed with it. See the libosmium README.\n   (Debian/Ubuntu: protozero)\n - [Utfcpp](http://utfcpp.sourceforge.net/)\n   This is included in the libosmium repository and might or might not\n   have been installed with it. See the libosmium README.\n   (Debian/Ubuntu: libutfcpp-dev)\n - [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) >= 1.55 with development headers\n   (Debian/Ubuntu: libboost-dev)\n - [zlib](http://www.zlib.net/)\n   (Debian/Ubuntu: zlib1g-dev)\n - [expat](http://expat.sourceforge.net/)\n   Debian/Ubuntu: libexpat1-dev\n\nSee also the dependency information for the Osmium library.\n\nSet dependencies up on Ubuntu Precise (12.04) like:\n\n```shell\nsudo apt-add-repository --yes ppa:chris-lea/node.js\nsudo apt-add-repository --yes ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test\nsudo apt-get -y update\nsudo apt-get -y install git gcc-4.8 g++-4.8 build-essential nodejs\nsudo apt-get -y install libboost-dev zlib1g-dev libexpat1-dev libsparsehash-dev\nexport CC=gcc-4.8\nexport CXX=g++-4.8\ngit clone https://github.com/scrosby/OSM-binary.git\ncd OSM-binary/src\nmake && sudo make install\n```\n\nSet dependencies up on OS X like:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik-packaging.git\ncd mapnik-packaging/osx\nexport CXX11=true\nsource MacOSX.sh\n./scripts/build_bzip2.sh\n./scripts/build_expat.sh\n./scripts/build_google_sparsetable.sh\n./scripts/build_boost.sh --with-test --with-program_options\n./scripts/build_protobuf.sh\n./scripts/build_osm-pbf.sh\n# NOTE: in the same terminal then run the build commands\n# Or from a different terminal re-run `source MacOSX.sh`\n```\n\n\n## Installing\n\nBy default, binaries are provided and no external dependencies or compile is\nneeded.\n\nJust do:\n\n```shell\nnpm install osmium\n```\n\nWe currently provide binaries for 64 bit OS X and 64 bit Linux. Running `npm\ninstall` on other platforms will fall back to a source compile (see\n`Developing` below for build details).\n\n\n## Usage\n\nSee [the tutorial](doc/tutorial.md) for an introduction. There are some demo\napplications in the 'demo' directory. See the [README.md](demo/README.md)\nthere. You can also have a look at the tests in the `test` directory.\n\n\n## Developing\n\nIf you wish to develop on `node-osmium` you can check out the code and then\nbuild like:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/osmcode/node-osmium.git\ncd node-osmium\nmake\n```\n\nUse `make debug` to build with debug information. Use `make coverage` to build\nwith code coverage.\n\nUse `make VERBOSE=1` to output compiler calls used etc.\n\n\n## Testing\n\n    npm install mocha\n    make test\n\n\n## License\n\nnode-osmium is available under the Boost Software License. See LICENSE.txt for\ndetails.\n\n\n## Contact\n\nPlease open bug reports on https://github.com/osmcode/node-osmium/issues. You\ncan ask questions on the\n[OSM developer mailing list](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/dev)\nor on [OFTC net IRC channel #osm-dev](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Irc).\n\n\n## Authors\n\n - Dane Springmeyer (dane@mapbox.com)\n - Jochen Topf (jochen@topf.org)\n\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2013-12-09T20:29:03.357Z","modified":"2017-08-10T00:04:43.434Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"springmeyer","email":"dane@mapbox.com"},"owners":[{"email":"ryan.clark.j@gmail.com","name":"rclark"},{"email":"aaronlidman@gmail.com","name":"aaronlidman"},{"email":"jochen@topf.org","name":"joto"},{"email":"dane@mapbox.com","name":"springmeyer"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"osmium","_nodeVersion":"4.8.3","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/osmium-0.5.6.tgz_1502323483283_0.12860069959424436"},"_npmUser":{"name":"springmeyer","email":"dane@mapbox.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.15.11","_rev":"5-21b10ee384f4294bc32c29ed8f46ff5c","_shasum":"f3e671521de21352db8ffe6b0ccfd43578f0f2c0","author":{"name":"Dane Springmeyer","email":"springmeyer"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/osmcode/node-osmium/issues","email":"dane@mapbox.com"},"contributors":[{"name":"Jochen Topf","email":"joto"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.5.6"},"dist":{"shasum":"f3e671521de21352db8ffe6b0ccfd43578f0f2c0","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/osmium/-/osmium-0.5.6.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"email":"ryan.clark.j@gmail.com","name":"rclark"},{"email":"aaronlidman@gmail.com","name":"aaronlidman"},{"email":"jochen@topf.org","name":"joto"},{"email":"dane@mapbox.com","name":"springmeyer"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-08-10T00:04:43.434Z","created":"2013-12-09T20:29:03.357Z","0.1.0":"2013-12-09T20:30:42.239Z","0.1.1":"2013-12-11T20:33:29.218Z","0.1.2":"2014-04-29T18:30:20.345Z","0.1.3":"2014-05-01T02:51:19.052Z","0.2.0":"2014-09-25T22:24:16.273Z","0.2.1":"2014-10-11T18:41:53.033Z","0.3.0":"2014-11-05T18:50:48.747Z","0.4.0":"2015-08-19T16:53:15.919Z","0.4.2":"2015-09-01T15:51:16.460Z","0.4.3":"2015-11-10T08:39:53.338Z","0.4.4":"2015-11-10T23:57:17.613Z","0.4.5":"2016-02-10T23:46:03.053Z","0.5.0":"2016-04-04T16:33:46.016Z","0.5.1":"2016-07-22T10:27:30.103Z","0.5.2":"2016-07-28T19:56:53.665Z","0.5.3":"2016-09-19T08:31:53.900Z","0.5.4":"2016-11-21T13:05:26.022Z","0.5.5":"2017-08-09T21:40:05.132Z","0.5.6":"2017-08-10T00:04:43.434Z"},"users":{"tyr_asd":true}}}
