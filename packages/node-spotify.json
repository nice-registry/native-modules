But I intend to wrap all\nlibspotify types and provide methods to access them where possible. Options and convenience features my lack, though.\n\nDependencies\n------------\n* libspotify must be installed\n    - Linux users get it from [here](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/)\n    - OSX users can use homebrew (`brew install libspotify`) or download it from\n      [here](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/)\n* an appkey for libspotify, get it [here](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/#application-keys).\n  Choose binary, not C code.\n* users of libspotify must have a Spotify premium account, this is required by Spotify.\n* (Linux only) If you want audio the ALSA audio system, should be installed in most distributions [1]\n\n[1] See building from source if you don't need/want platform-native audio (i.e. ALSA/OpenAL) in node-spotify.\n\nBuilding from source\n--------------------\nnode-spotify is prebuilt with [node-pre-gyp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-pre-gyp). If your NodeJS version or\narchitecture is not available it will build automatically from source.\n\nIf you want to force a build from source you can run `npm install node-spotify --build-from-source`. There's one special\noption you can set when compiling node-spotify: `--native_audio=false` will compile/link no ALSA/OpenAL audio code\n(depending on your platform). Default is `true`. This is both settable for node-gyp and npm.\n\nnode-spotify uses [Nan](https://github.com/nodejs/nan) to compile on different NodeJS versions. 0.10, 0.12, 4.x, 5.x, 6.x.\nshould all work.\n\n\nIf you use OSX and have installed libspotify as a framework you need to edit the binding.gyp file. Remove \"-lspotify\" and\nwrite instead as one link option: `\"-framework OpenAL -framework libspotify\"`. This is due to a bug in node-gyp\nthat will eliminate a duplicate \"-framework\" entry from the link settings. If you have installed libspotify via homebrew\nyou don't need this step.\n\nUsed software\n-------------\n* Base64 encoder from https://github.com/superwills/NibbleAndAHalf\n* Sound playback is heavily based on https://developer.spotify.com/docs/libspotify/12.1.51/examples.html\n","starsCount":2,"created":"2013-11-06T20:48:33.776Z","modified":"2016-07-10T12:10:51.321Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"frontierpsychiatrist","email":"moritz.schulze@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"frontierpsychiatrist","email":"moritz.schulze@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"node-spotify","_nodeVersion":"6.2.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/node-spotify-0.8.1.tgz_1466626179223_0.2247298783622682"},"_npmUser":{"name":"frontierpsychiatrist","email":"moritz.schulze@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.9.3","_rev":"1-42062c4613d53ff312e51fed59a75777","_shasum":"1570deb5f684c6542fbbdf6be8b5c992d6950162","author":{"name":"Moritz Schulze","email":"moritz.schulze@gmail.com","url":"http://www.node-spotify.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/FrontierPsychiatrist/node-spotify/issues","email":"moritz.schulze@gmail.com"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.8.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"1570deb5f684c6542fbbdf6be8b5c992d6950162","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/node-spotify/-/node-spotify-0.8.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"frontierpsychiatrist","email":"moritz.schulze@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-07-10T12:10:51.321Z","created":"2013-11-06T20:48:33.776Z","0.4.0":"2013-11-06T20:48:40.357Z","0.4.1":"2013-11-21T21:22:35.441Z","0.5.0":"2014-03-10T17:32:08.603Z","0.5.1":"2014-03-21T19:23:50.665Z","0.5.2":"2014-04-20T09:50:26.444Z","0.5.3":"2014-05-03T09:04:08.736Z","0.5.4":"2014-05-11T10:59:16.756Z","0.6.0":"2014-05-23T15:03:11.913Z","0.7.0":"2014-12-28T12:24:13.761Z","0.7.1":"2015-03-03T19:59:07.892Z","0.7.2":"2016-06-05T12:44:42.848Z","0.7.3-alpha":"2016-06-11T09:16:51.623Z","0.7.3":"2016-06-11T09:31:49.089Z","0.8.0":"2016-06-22T20:02:28.706Z","0.8.1":"2016-06-22T20:09:41.222Z","0.8.2":"2016-07-10T12:08:44.176Z"},"users":{"rtc11":true,"rchk":true}}}
