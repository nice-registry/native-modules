It supports graph layouts in 1D, 2D,\n3D, and 4D spaces. It also can be compiled with OpenMP support, which boosts\nperformance even further, by leveraging multi-threading techniques.\n\n# WARNING\n\nThis is not supposed to be used yet. Sometimes it may crash/hang.\n\n# Install\n\nCurrently only OSX/Linux platforms are supported.\n\n``` shell\ngit clone https://github.com/anvaka/nanlayout\ncd nanlayout\nnpm install\n```\n\nThis will download all dependencies and will attempt to compile the module.\nIf you run into any compilation errors, you can always recompile it with:\n\n``` shell\nnpm run configure\nnpm run build\n```\n\n## compiling with openmp\n\nBy default the build you get from `npm run build` is single-threaded. If you want\nto create multi-threaded build, keep reading.\n\n### OSX\n\nYou will need to install OpenMP enabled clang compiler. I used [clang-omp](https://clang-omp.github.io/)\nduring development:\n\n```\nbrew install clang-omp\n```\n\nBefore compiling this library with this compiler, make sure it's exported:\n\n```\nexport CXX=`which clang-omp++`\n```\n\nIt is also expected that `libiomp5` library is located at `/usr/local/lib/libiomp5.dylib`\n\nOnce all prerequisites are met, run:\n\n```\nnpm run configure-omp\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThis should generate OpenMP build.\n\n### Linux\n\nI used gcc compiler version 4.8.4. This produced OpenMP build:\n\n```\nnpm run configure-omp\nnpm run build\n```\n\nIf you run into any issues - let me know.\n\n# API\n\nIt's unstable and will likely change. See `test` directory for the reference.\n","created":"2016-06-13T06:26:43.927Z","modified":"2016-06-16T05:55:43.951Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"anvaka","email":"anvaka@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"anvaka","email":"anvaka@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"nanlayout","_nodeVersion":"5.11.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/nanlayout-2.0.3.tgz_1466056543534_0.708942424505949"},"_npmUser":{"name":"anvaka","email":"anvaka@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.8.6","_rev":"1-e0f6d66543b276cf31101f207e8badea","_shasum":"953c4ecacbc68e32651cec9c9419c7571b3f3b80","author":{"name":"Andrei Kashcha"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"2.0.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"953c4ecacbc68e32651cec9c9419c7571b3f3b80","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/nanlayout/-/nanlayout-2.0.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"anvaka","email":"anvaka@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-06-16T05:55:43.951Z","created":"2016-06-13T06:26:43.927Z","2.0.0":"2016-06-13T06:26:43.927Z","2.0.1":"2016-06-14T06:38:17.874Z","2.0.2":"2016-06-16T05:52:24.758Z","2.0.3":"2016-06-16T05:55:43.951Z"}}}
