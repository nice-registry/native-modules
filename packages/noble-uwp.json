But the Windows 10\r\nCreators Update has\r\n[finally improved the BLE support](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2017/01/13/new-bluetooth-features-in-creators-update-gatt-server-bluetooth-le).\r\nThis project is an implementation of bindings for `noble` using that newly available\r\nfunctionality in Windows 10.\r\n\r\n## System Requirements\r\n * Node.js v6 or later.\r\n * Windows 10 build 10.0.15063 or later\r\n * Windows 10 SDK build 10.0.15063\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nSimply require `noble-uwp` instead of `noble`:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst noble = require('noble-uwp');\r\n```\r\nThen [use it in the same way as the regular `noble`](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/noble/blob/master/README.md).\r\nOn non-Windows platforms, the benavior is unchanged from `noble`, while on Windows the UWP bindings are used instead\r\nof `noble`'s Bluetooth HCI bindings.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nSo far, testing has been done with a TI SensorTag.\r\n\r\nFirst, make sure you have the\r\n[necessary prerequisites for building Node.js native modules](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools).\r\nThen, make sure a SensorTag is powered on (light is blinking) and within range, and use the\r\nfollowing commands to set up and run tests from Windows PowerShell:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\ngit clone https://github.com/sandeepmistry/node-sensortag\r\ncd node-sensortag\r\nnpm install\r\nnpm install noble-uwp\r\nnode -e \"var fs = require('fs'), `\r\n  f = 'node_modules/noble-device/lib/util.js'; `\r\n  fs.writeFileSync(f, fs.readFileSync(f).toString().replace(`\r\n    'require(\\'noble\\')', 'require(\\'noble-uwp\\')'))\"\r\n$env:DEBUG=\"noble-uwp\"\r\nnode test.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n * The NodeRT adapter libraries may take a few minutes to build with `node-gyp`; please be patient.\r\n * The above string replacement in the `noble-device` source file is necessary to get it to use\r\n   the `noble-uwp` package instead of regular `noble`.\r\n * The `DEBUG` environment variable setting is optional; set it if you want to see verbose console\r\n   output from `noble-uwp`.\r\n\r\n## Implementation Status\r\nThe following functionality is working:\r\n * Device discovery\r\n * Device services discovery\r\n * Service included services discovery\r\n * Service characteristics discovery\r\n * Characteristic reading and writing\r\n * Characteristic change notifications\r\n * Descriptors (discovering, reading, writing)\r\n\r\nThe following functionality is not yet implemented:\r\n * Broadcast\r\n","created":"2017-01-30T06:29:02.780Z","modified":"2017-08-03T00:30:47.993Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"jasongin","email":"jasongin@microsoft.com"},"owners":[{"name":"jasongin","email":"jasongin@microsoft.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"noble-uwp","_nodeVersion":"6.10.3","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/noble-uwp-0.5.4.tgz_1501720247538_0.5718099265359342"},"_npmUser":{"name":"jasongin","email":"jasongin@microsoft.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.10","_rev":"14-c04bd7c9d6966544ecb2866d5d90fb8f","_shasum":"c7097009b94808bf10690ab981669accdd684c51","author":{"name":"jasongin","email":"jasongin@microsoft.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jasongin/noble-uwp/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.5.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"c7097009b94808bf10690ab981669accdd684c51","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/noble-uwp/-/noble-uwp-0.5.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"jasongin","email":"jasongin@microsoft.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-08-03T00:30:47.993Z","created":"2017-01-30T06:29:02.780Z","0.1.0":"2017-01-30T06:29:02.780Z","0.2.0":"2017-02-15T08:43:08.475Z","0.3.0":"2017-05-17T19:08:19.642Z","0.3.1":"2017-05-18T19:01:05.716Z","0.3.2":"2017-05-19T16:32:47.892Z","0.4.1":"2017-07-07T19:41:53.278Z","0.4.2":"2017-07-07T20:38:14.498Z","0.4.3":"2017-07-07T21:08:33.455Z","0.4.4":"2017-07-11T17:31:44.619Z","0.5.0":"2017-07-28T04:21:36.373Z","0.5.1":"2017-07-31T05:20:40.510Z","0.5.2":"2017-08-01T05:50:34.921Z","0.5.3":"2017-08-02T04:15:52.438Z","0.5.4":"2017-08-03T00:30:47.993Z"}}}
