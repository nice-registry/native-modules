So, if you are building a\ngrid of LEDs you can just use an alternating, top-to-bottom or mirrored wiring\nand use the remapping in order to use a unified structure in the incoming\ndata-arrays.\n\n### Events\n\nIn addition to that, the exported object is an `EventEmitter` that will emit\nthe following Events:\n\n * `beforeRender`: emitted just before the data is prepared and sent to the\n   LED-driver. The handler will receive the pixel-data array (an `Uint32Array`)\n   as single argument. As this event is handled synchronously, you can use this\n   to manipulate the data before it is sent to the LED-Strip.\n * `render`: emitted after the data has been sent to the LED-Strip. The single\n   argument passed to the handler is the final pixel-data array, after\n   index-remapping and gamma-correction.\n\n\n## testing basic functionality\n\nconnect the WS2812-strip to the raspberry-pi as described\n[here](https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixels-on-raspberry-pi/wiring) and run\nthe command `sudo node examples/rainbow.js <numLeds>`.\nYou should now see some rainbow-colors animation on the LED-strip.\n\n\n## needs to run as root\n\nAs the native part of this module needs to directly interface with the physical\nmemory of the raspberry-pi (which is required in order to configure the PWM and\nDMA-modules), it always has to run with root-privileges (there are probably ways\naround this requirement, but that doesn't change the fact that the node-process\nrunning the LEDs needs access to the raw physical memory â€“ a thing you should\nnever allow to any user other than root).\n\nIf you are using this module as part of a program that should not be run with\nelevated privileges, it would be a good idea to have the LED-driver running in\na seperate process. In such a case you could use the openpixel-control protocol\nto send the pixel-data to the driver-process.\nA stream-based node-implementation and some more information\n[can be found here](https://github.com/beyondscreen/node-openpixelcontrol).\n\n\n## Hardware\n\nThere is a guide [over at adafruit.com](https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixels-on-raspberry-pi)\non how to get the hardware up and running. I followed these instructions by\nthe word and had a working LED-strip.\n\nEssentially, you need the Raspberry Pi, a logic-level converter to shift the\noutput-voltage of the GPIO from 3.3V up to 5V (the guide mentions the 74AHCT125,\nmine is an 74HCT125N which works just as well) and of course a LED-Strip or\nother types of WS2812-LEDs.\n\nTo connect all that together, I'd recommend buying a small breadboard and some\njumper-wires. Also, consider buying a 5V power-supply that can deliver up to\n60mA per LED (so you'll need up to 6A (30W) to fully power 100 LEDs).\nFor smaller applications, a decent USB-charger should do.\n\n### Buying stuff\n\nA short checklist of what you will need:\n\n * Raspberry-PI and SD-Card\n * 5V power-supply (Meanwell for instance builds really good ones)\n * LED-Strip with WS2811/WS2812 Controllers (there are several other\n   controller-variations that are not supported)\n * a breadboard and some jumper-wires (m/m as well as at least two f/m to\n   connect the GPIO-Pins)\n * a 3.3V to 5V logic-level converter (74AHCT125 or 74HCT125N, others will\n   probably also work)\n * more wire to connect the LED-strips\n\nYou can buy everything at [adafruit.com](https://adafruit.com),\n[sparkfun](https://sparkfun.com), on ebay or your favourite electronics\nretailer (germany: check [conrad electronic](http://www.conrad.de),\n[watterott](http://watterott.com) or [reichelt](http://reichelt.de) where\ni bought most of my stuff).\n\n\n## Known Issues\n\nThere is a conflict where the internal soundcard uses the same \nGPIO / DMA / PWM functions that are needed to run the LED-drivers. \nAs far as I know you can not use both at the same time.\n\nOne workaround is to use an external (USB) soundcard and make it the \ndefault device:\n\nEdit /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf and comment out the line \n\n    options snd-usb-audio index=-2\n\nIf anyone finds a better solution please get in touch!\n","starsCount":5,"created":"2014-11-18T22:11:05.319Z","modified":"2017-05-16T22:36:57.936Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"usefulthink","email":"m.schuhfuss@googlemail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"usefulthink","email":"m.schuhfuss@googlemail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"rpi-ws281x-native","_nodeVersion":"7.10.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/rpi-ws281x-native-0.8.2.tgz_1494974215931_0.2621109129395336"},"_npmUser":{"name":"usefulthink","email":"m.schuhfuss@googlemail.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.6.1","_rev":"2-a149b5d146b69d5fab7a79cf5eec1523","_shasum":"58cc32bd7ff9fc68763e6452ba18e1d0be6ab3b2","author":{"name":"Martin Schuhfuss","email":"m.schuhfuss@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/beyondscreen/node-rpi-ws281x-native/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.8.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"58cc32bd7ff9fc68763e6452ba18e1d0be6ab3b2","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/rpi-ws281x-native/-/rpi-ws281x-native-0.8.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"usefulthink","email":"m.schuhfuss@googlemail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-05-16T22:36:57.936Z","created":"2014-11-18T22:11:05.319Z","0.0.1":"2014-11-18T22:11:05.319Z","0.1.0":"2014-11-19T00:45:11.202Z","0.1.1":"2014-11-19T00:52:07.712Z","0.1.2":"2014-11-19T10:14:22.792Z","0.1.3":"2015-02-28T14:00:30.521Z","0.1.4":"2015-03-03T14:06:01.981Z","0.2.0":"2015-03-11T23:36:47.148Z","0.3.0":"2015-04-02T17:18:28.787Z","0.4.0":"2015-04-05T17:14:04.327Z","0.5.0":"2015-10-03T13:33:22.947Z","0.7.0":"2015-11-22T13:04:50.162Z","0.7.1":"2015-11-22T13:07:26.826Z","0.7.2":"2015-11-22T13:13:07.476Z","0.8.0":"2015-11-27T01:10:13.105Z","0.8.1":"2015-11-27T09:58:40.333Z","0.8.2":"2017-05-16T22:36:57.936Z"},"users":{"lasar":true,"goliatone":true,"paulrichards19":true,"manewu":true,"rbultitude":true}}}
