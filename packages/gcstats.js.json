This can grow if usedHeap needs more.\n * usedHeapSize: Number of bytes in use by application data\n * total HeapExecutableSize: Number of bytes for compiled bytecode and JITed code\n * heapSizeLimit: The absolute limit the heap cannot exceed\n * totalPhysicalSize: Commited size (node 0.11+)\n * pause: Nanoseconds from start to end of GC using hrtime()\n\ngctype can have the following values:\n * 1: Scavenge (minor GC)\n * 2: Mark/Sweep/Compact (major GC)\n * 3: Both 1 and 2\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install --save gcstats.js\n```\n\n## Node version compatibility\nnode-gcstats depends on C++ extensions which are compiled when the *gc-stats* module is installed. Compatibility information can be inspected via the [Travis-CI build jobs](https://travis-ci.org/dainis/node-gcstats/) and the [compatibility file](https://github.com/bripkens/node-gcstats/blob/develop/compatibility.md).\n\n## Credits\n`node-gcstats` was written by @dainis and later adopted by @bripkens.\n","created":"2015-10-03T16:40:53.052Z","modified":"2015-10-03T16:40:53.052Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"bripkens","email":"bripkens.dev@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"bripkens","email":"bripkens.dev@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"gcstats.js","_nodeVersion":"4.1.0","_npmUser":{"name":"bripkens","email":"bripkens.dev@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.3","_rev":"1-200809039d60722b39b6a8a827ddf4c7","_shasum":"85d19ca97bf3e44214ea3474c0b621e4b7a10090","author":{"name":"Ben Ripkens","email":"bripkens.dev@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/bripkens/node-gcstats/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"85d19ca97bf3e44214ea3474c0b621e4b7a10090","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/gcstats.js/-/gcstats.js-1.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"bripkens","email":"bripkens.dev@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-10-03T16:40:53.052Z","created":"2015-10-03T16:40:53.052Z","1.0.0":"2015-10-03T16:40:53.052Z"}}}
