If it fails to do so,\nit boots to a Node.js [REPL](http://nodejs.org/api/repl.html) prompt using an\non-memory root filesystem.\n\n## Note about *env.js*\n\nSince `/usr/bin/env` is also a Node.js script, to use less memory and boot\nfaster it's checking that the script to be run is already a Node.js script and\nif so, it `require()`s it and exec it directly to re-use the current Node.js\ninstance. This has the drawback that Python-inspired tricks like\n`!module.parent` or `require.main === module` will not work anymore. A better\nalternative and currently more widely used when a package can be used both as a\nlibrary and as an executable is to define the executable at an independent\nscript file and use the `package.json` *main* and *bin* entries.\n","created":"2015-04-10T19:14:08.699Z","modified":"2017-04-04T13:05:14.017Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"nodeos","email":"groundwater+nodeos@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"nodeos-bot","email":"pirann.a@gmail.com"},{"name":"piranna","email":"piranna@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"nodeos-initramfs","_nodeVersion":"5.0.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/nodeos-initramfs-1.0.0-RC3.2.tgz_1487445459313_0.27533216145820916"},"_npmUser":{"name":"nodeos","email":"groundwater+nodeos@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.3.6","_rev":"20-9991a37f112fb7a669cac8b49a88121b","_shasum":"27599184fbfe5176f5dee0a0062d711f4178c81d","author":{"name":"Jesús Leganés Combarro 'piranna'","email":"piranna@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/NodeOS/nodeos-initramfs/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0-RC3.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"27599184fbfe5176f5dee0a0062d711f4178c81d","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/nodeos-initramfs/-/nodeos-initramfs-1.0.0-RC3.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"nodeos-bot","email":"pirann.a@gmail.com"},{"name":"piranna","email":"piranna@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-04-04T13:05:14.017Z","created":"2015-04-10T19:14:08.699Z","0.0.0":"2015-04-10T19:14:08.699Z","0.0.1":"2015-04-10T20:12:04.765Z","1.0.0-RC2":"2016-06-19T15:29:07.635Z","1.0.0-RC2.1":"2016-06-20T00:29:53.853Z","1.0.0-RC2.2":"2016-06-21T13:20:22.703Z","1.0.0-RC2.3":"2016-06-24T13:21:06.807Z","1.0.0-RC2.4":"2016-06-24T13:54:03.616Z","1.0.0-RC3":"2016-12-07T09:50:28.543Z","1.0.0-RC3.0":"2017-01-11T14:56:25.691Z","1.0.0-RC3.1":"2017-01-14T23:48:50.779Z","1.0.0-RC3.2":"2017-02-18T19:17:41.105Z"}}}
