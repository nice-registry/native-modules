Since `node-pre-gyp-init` is\nasync, your JavaScript API will also need to be async.\n\n```javascript\nvar init = require('node-pre-gyp-init');\n\nmodule.exports.myNativeFunction = function (callback) {\n    init(path.resolve(__dirname, './package.json'), function (err, bindingPath) {\n\t\tif (err) {\n            return callback(err);\n        }\n\n\t\tvar binding = require(bindingPath);\n        var result = binding.whatever();\n        callback(null, result);\n\t});\n};\n```\n\nIf you are trying to use someone else's native module, then you can do something\nlike:\n\n```javascript\nvar init = require('node-pre-gyp-init');\nvar modulePath = require.resolve('some-native-module');\n\ninit(path.resolve(modulePath, './package.json'), function (err, bindingPath) {\n    if (err) {\n        console.error(err);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    var someNativeModule = require('some-native-module');\n    someNativeModule.doNativeThings();\n});\n```\n\nIn the above example, `node-pre-gyp-init` is simply being used to make sure the\nnative binding exists before requiring the actual native module.\n\n## API\n\ninit(pathToPackageJson, callback)\n\n * `pathToPackageJson` (string) - The path to the native module's package.json.\n * `callback(err, bindingPath)` (function) - A function to call after resolving\n   the binding path.\n\nReturns an `EventEmitter` where you can listen for the following events:\n\n * `success` - The native binding was found.\n\n   Parameters:\n   * `bindingPath` (string) - The path to the resolved native module.\n\n\n * `error` - Failed to install the pre-compiled binding or locate the binding\n   after it was successfully compiled.\n\n   Parameters:\n   * `err` (Error) - The error details. If the error was because of a build\n     error, then the return code is stored in `err.code`.\n\n\n * `stdout` and `stderr` - Output directly from the `node-pre-gyp` subprocess.\n   This is handy if you need to debug what `node-pre-gyp` is doing.\n\n   Parameters:\n   * `output` (string) - The output from `node-pre-gyp`.\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 Chris Barber\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
