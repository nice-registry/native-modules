Use this option with `gulp.watch` to keep gulp from stopping every time you mess up your sass.\n\n#### `onSuccess: callback`\n\nPass in your own callback to be called upon successful compilation by node-sass. The callback has the form `callback(css)`, and is passed the compiled css as a string. Note: This *does not* prevent gulp.sass's default behavior of writing the output css file.\n\n#### `onError: callback`\n\nPass in your own callback to be called upon a sass error from node-sass. The callback has the form `callback(err)`, where err is the error string generated by libsass. Note: this *does* prevent an actual `gulpPluginError` object from being created.\n\n#### `sync: true`\n\nIf you pass `sync: true` into the options hash, sass.renderSync will be called, instead of sass.render. This should help when memory and/or cpu usage is getting very high when rendering many and/or big files.\n\n## Source Maps\n\ngulp.sass can be used in tandem with [gulp-sourcemaps](https://github.com/floridoo/gulp-sourcemaps) to generate source maps for the SASS to CSS compilation. You will need to initialize [gulp-sourcemaps](https://github.com/floridoo/gulp-sourcemaps) prior to running the gulp.sass compiler and write the source maps after.\n\n```javascript\nvar sourcemaps = require('gulp-sourcemaps');\n\ngulp.src('./scss/*.scss')\n  .pipe(sourcemaps.init())\n    .pipe(sass())\n  .pipe(sourcemaps.write())\n  .pipe(gulp.dest('./css');\n\n// will write the source maps inline in the compiled CSS files\n```\n\nBy default, [gulp-sourcemaps](https://github.com/floridoo/gulp-sourcemaps) writes the source maps inline in the compiled CSS files. To write them to a separate file, specify a relative file path in the `sourcemaps.write()` function.\n\n```javascript\nvar sourcemaps = require('gulp-sourcemaps');\n\ngulp.src('./scss/*.scss')\n  .pipe(sourcemaps.init())\n    .pipe(sass())\n  .pipe(sourcemaps.write('./maps'))\n  .pipe(gulp.dest('./css'));\n\n// will write the source maps to ./dest/css/maps\n```\n\n#Imports and Partials\n\ngulp.sass now automatically passes along the directory of every scss file it parses as an include path for node-sass. This means that as long as you specify your includes relative to path of your scss file, everything will just work.\n\nscss/includes/_settings.scss:\n\n```scss\n$blue: #3bbfce;\n$margin: 16px;\n```\n\nscss/style.scss:\n\n```scss\n@import \"includes/settings\";\n\n.content-navigation {\n  border-color: $blue;\n  color:\n    darken($blue, 9%);\n}\n\n.border {\n  padding: $margin / 2;\n  margin: $margin / 2;\n  border-color: $blue;\n}\n```\n\n#Issues\n\nBefore submitting an issue, please understand that gulp.sass is only a wrapper for [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass), which in turn is a node front end for [libsass](https://github.com/sass/libsass). Missing sass features and errors should not be reported here.\n","created":"2015-12-23T04:44:50.437Z","modified":"2015-12-23T05:47:42.154Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"keelii","email":"keeliizhou@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"keelii","email":"keeliizhou@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"gulp.sass","_nodeVersion":"0.12.7","_npmUser":{"name":"keelii","email":"keeliizhou@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.11.3","_rev":"1-46dda61659c6ffaa2321f5018e030c26","_shasum":"0b1077520c35dd8793e4b5391dd7fac39c7e6b40","author":{"name":"keelii"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/devfe/gulp.sass/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.3.9"},"dist":{"shasum":"0b1077520c35dd8793e4b5391dd7fac39c7e6b40","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/gulp.sass/-/gulp.sass-1.3.9.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"keelii","email":"keeliizhou@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-12-23T05:47:42.154Z","created":"2015-12-23T04:44:50.437Z","1.3.3":"2015-12-23T04:44:50.437Z","1.3.4":"2015-12-23T04:53:21.237Z","1.3.5":"2015-12-23T04:56:18.450Z","1.3.6":"2015-12-23T05:13:31.637Z","1.3.7":"2015-12-23T05:35:37.970Z","1.3.8":"2015-12-23T05:46:01.065Z","1.3.9":"2015-12-23T05:47:42.154Z"}}}
