(y/n): n\nSystem user to run under (root):\nSet max file descriptors (1000000):\nWorking directory for process (/files/lcdstats): /tmp\nRespawn automatically? (y/n): y\n```\n\nFinally start the service:\n\n``` bash\nsudo service lcdstats start\n```\n\n# Configuration\n\nCopy the `conf/settings.example.js` file to `conf/settings.js`, then edit it and\nconfigure which modules you want to display.\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n\tdevice: '/dev/ttyUSB0',\n\tbitrate: 19200,\n\trefreshInterval: 2000,\n\tmodules: [\n\t\t{ name: 'disk', device: '/dev/sda1' },\n        // { name: 'mdraid', device: '/dev/md0' },\n\t\t{ name: 'memory' },\n\t\t{ name: 'sensors' },\n\t\t{ name: 'uptime' },\n\t\t{ name: 'loadavg' },\n\t\t{ name: 'backup', lastBackup: '/var/run/last-backup', backingUp: '/tmp/backing-up' },\n\t\t{ name: 'net', interface: 'eth0' }\n\t],\n};\n```\n\nYou may have more than one of a specific module. For example, you can have two\nmodules set for displaying `/dev/sda1` and `/dev/sdb1`.\n\n# Debug\n\nYou run lcdstats in a sort of \"debug\" mode by specifying the `--debug` flag:\n\n```bash\nlcdstats --debug\n```\n\n# License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013-2015 Chris Barber\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
