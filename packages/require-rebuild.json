Now all further `require()` calls, no matter how deep in your dependency tree,  will make sure a native module has been compiled for the right node version.\n\n  To see it in action, install a native module, then switch to a different node version with a different abi, and see how it rebuilds on the fly:\n\n```bash\n$ node example.js\nRecompiling node_modules/bignum\nCXX(target) Release/obj.target/bignum/bignum.o\nSOLINK_MODULE(target) Release/bignum.node\nDone!\n```\n\n## General warning\n\nThis belongs into application code, not into a lib. Better leave it to a lib's consumer how to build their dependencies.\n\n## Build systems\n\nAt this moment, those build systems are supported\n\n- `node-gyp`\n- `prebuild`\n\n## License\n\n  MIT\n\n","created":"2016-01-18T13:53:20.792Z","modified":"2016-05-22T14:02:14.343Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"juliangruber","email":"julian@juliangruber.com"},"owners":[{"name":"juliangruber","email":"julian@juliangruber.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"require-rebuild","_nodeVersion":"5.4.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/require-rebuild-1.2.8.tgz_1463925733313_0.9564599778968841"},"_npmUser":{"name":"juliangruber","email":"julian@juliangruber.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.3.12","_rev":"1-cac0296a4b3f4c5f36a764cd961cc94d","_shasum":"4fb3ea6512510382a6464da606f4e615b082e977","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/juliangruber/require-rebuild/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.2.8"},"dist":{"shasum":"4fb3ea6512510382a6464da606f4e615b082e977","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/require-rebuild/-/require-rebuild-1.2.8.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"juliangruber","email":"julian@juliangruber.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-05-22T14:02:14.343Z","created":"2016-01-18T13:53:20.792Z","1.0.0":"2016-01-18T13:53:20.792Z","1.1.0":"2016-01-18T20:36:26.839Z","1.1.1":"2016-01-18T20:42:53.350Z","1.1.2":"2016-01-18T20:46:43.910Z","1.2.0":"2016-01-20T08:31:51.114Z","1.2.1":"2016-01-20T08:35:43.077Z","1.2.2":"2016-01-25T18:31:07.617Z","1.2.3":"2016-01-27T10:18:18.224Z","1.2.4":"2016-01-27T19:58:32.059Z","1.2.5":"2016-01-27T20:04:23.089Z","1.2.6":"2016-01-27T22:07:16.071Z","1.2.7":"2016-05-22T14:00:56.631Z","1.2.8":"2016-05-22T14:02:14.343Z"}}}
