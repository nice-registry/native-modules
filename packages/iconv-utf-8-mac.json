The logical input is a\nsingle document (the full POST request data) but the physical input will be\nspread over several buffers (the request chunks).\n\nYou must accumulate the small buffers into a single large buffer before\nperforming the conversion. If you don't, you will get unexpected results with\nmulti-byte and stateful character sets like UTF-8 and ISO-2022-JP.\n\nThe above only applies when you are calling `Iconv#convert()` yourself.\nIf you use the streaming interface, node-iconv takes care of stitching\npartial character sequences together again.\n\n### Dealing with untranslatable characters\n\nCharacters are not always translatable to another encoding. The UTF-8 string\n\"ça va が\", for example, cannot be represented in plain 7-bits ASCII without\nsome loss of fidelity.\n\nBy default, node-iconv throws EILSEQ when untranslatabe characters are\nencountered but this can be customized. Quoting the `iconv_open(3)` man page:\n\n    //TRANSLIT\n    When  the  string  \"//TRANSLIT\"  is appended to tocode, transliteration is\n    activated. This means that when a character cannot be represented in the\n    target character set, it can be approximated through one or several\n    similarly looking characters.\n\n    //IGNORE\n    When the string \"//IGNORE\" is appended to tocode, characters that cannot be\n    represented in the target character set will be silently discarded.\n\nExample usage:\n\n    var iconv = new Iconv('UTF-8', 'ASCII');\n    iconv.convert('ça va'); // throws EILSEQ\n\n    var iconv = new Iconv('UTF-8', 'ASCII//IGNORE');\n    iconv.convert('ça va'); // returns \"a va\"\n\n    var iconv = new Iconv('UTF-8', 'ASCII//TRANSLIT');\n    iconv.convert('ça va'); // \"ca va\"\n\n    var iconv = new Iconv('UTF-8', 'ASCII//TRANSLIT//IGNORE');\n    iconv.convert('ça va が'); // \"ca va \"\n\n### EINVAL\n\nEINVAL is raised when the input ends in a partial character sequence. This is a\nfeature, not a bug.\n\n[iconv-lite]: https://www.npmjs.org/package/iconv-lite\n","created":"2015-05-11T07:10:00.322Z","modified":"2017-01-09T00:48:48.994Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"kuronekomichael","email":"michael@cat.email.ne.jp"},"owners":[{"name":"kuronekomichael","email":"michael@cat.email.ne.jp"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"iconv-utf-8-mac","_nodeVersion":"7.4.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/iconv-utf-8-mac-2.3.0.tgz_1483922926299_0.12061599316075444"},"_npmUser":{"name":"kuronekomichael","email":"michael@cat.email.ne.jp"},"_npmVersion":"4.0.5","_rev":"3-241ccd00c12c5ac27fe617d3413306ed","_shasum":"838792fb66a79c34fc2af87a5a91fa06f03136f5","author":{"name":"Ben Noordhuis","email":"info@bnoordhuis.nl"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/kuronekomichael/node-iconv-utf-8-mac/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"2.3.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"838792fb66a79c34fc2af87a5a91fa06f03136f5","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/iconv-utf-8-mac/-/iconv-utf-8-mac-2.3.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"kuronekomichael","email":"michael@cat.email.ne.jp"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-01-09T00:48:48.994Z","created":"2015-05-11T07:10:00.322Z","2.1.7":"2015-05-11T07:10:00.322Z","2.1.8":"2015-08-22T01:49:54.638Z","2.2.0":"2015-12-26T18:21:09.306Z","2.2.2":"2017-01-08T09:48:05.974Z","2.3.0":"2017-01-09T00:48:48.994Z"}}}
