Some of our users\nexperienced trouble installing pathwatcher because of runas\n(compare [runas/#9][9], [runas/#11][11] or [markdown-preview-plus/#43][43]).\n\nRunas is just needed in a rather small edge case on macosx, if write files and\nthe file is not accessible (compare [here][runas-ref]). We didn't write files\nwith pathwatcher, so we removed the usage of runas in this package.\n\nIf you do not use pathwatcher with writing capabilities, feel free to use this\npackage.\n\n## Installing\n\n```bash\nnpm install pathwatcher-without-runas\n```\n\n## Building\n\n*   Clone the repository\n*   Run `npm install` to install the dependencies\n*   Run `npm test` to run the specs\n\n## Using\n\n```coffeescript\nPathWatcher = require 'pathwatcher'\n```\n\n### PathWatcher.watch(filename, \\[listener])\n\nWatch for changes on `filename`, where `filename` is either a file or a\ndirectory. The returned object is a PathWatcher.\n\nThe listener callback gets two arguments `(event, path)`. `event` is 'rename',\n'delete' or 'change', and `path` is the path of the file which triggered the\nevent.\n\nFor directories, the 'change' event is emitted when a file or directory under\nthe watched directory got created or deleted. And the `PathWatcher.watch` is\nnot recursive, so changes of subdirectories under the watched directory would\nnot be detected.\n\n### PathWatcher.close()\n\nStop watching for changes on the given `PathWatcher`.\n\n[9]: https://github.com/atom/node-runas/issues/9\n[11]: https://github.com/atom/node-runas/issues/11\n[43]: https://github.com/Galadirith/markdown-preview-plus/issues/43\n[45]: https://github.com/Galadirith/markdown-preview-plus/issues/45\n\n[runas-ref]: https://github.com/atom/node-pathwatcher/blob/849e893fbe3a1f7d21b9c06318c1aa94330526a4/src/file.coffee#L317-L328\n\n[pathwatcher]: (https://github.com/atom/node-pathwatcher)\n\n[ai]: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/4ws8m57yahqhkkb2/branch/master?svg=true\n[a]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/leipert/node-pathwatcher-without-runas\n\n[ti]: https://travis-ci.org/leipert/node-pathwatcher-without-runas.svg?branch=master\n[t]: https://travis-ci.org/leipert/node-pathwatcher-without-runas\n\n[wi]: https://app.wercker.com/status/c8f03d83fd02af89cc233aea01edff61/s/master\n[w]: https://app.wercker.com/project/bykey/c8f03d83fd02af89cc233aea01edff61\n","created":"2015-08-11T08:55:45.695Z","modified":"2015-08-11T09:35:09.867Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"leipert","email":"git@valedictorum.de"},"owners":[{"name":"leipert","email":"git@valedictorum.de"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"pathwatcher-without-runas","_nodeVersion":"0.12.7","_npmUser":{"name":"leipert","email":"git@valedictorum.de"},"_npmVersion":"2.13.1","_rev":"1-40a3b98a36a5ef5bbd799e58dc6b15a0","_shasum":"cd9155f5941aba4887fcbc4d88b5f4e72330c12b","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/leipert/node-pathwatcher/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"4.5.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"cd9155f5941aba4887fcbc4d88b5f4e72330c12b","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/pathwatcher-without-runas/-/pathwatcher-without-runas-4.5.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"leipert","email":"git@valedictorum.de"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-08-11T09:35:09.867Z","created":"2015-08-11T08:55:45.695Z","4.4.5":"2015-08-11T08:55:45.695Z","4.5.0":"2015-08-11T09:35:09.867Z"}}}
