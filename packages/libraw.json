The API is susceptible to change at any moment**\n\n## Supported platforms\n\n* Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS\n* OSX sierra\n\n## Usage\n\n``` js\nimport libraw from 'libraw';\n\n// For extracting the RAW tiff\nlibraw.extract('./test.raf', './output')\n  .then((output) => {\n    console.log(output);\n  });\n\n// For extracting the embedded jpg thumbnail\nlibraw.extractThumb('./test.raf', './output')\n  .then((output) => {\n    console.log(output);\n  });\n```\n\n## Note on LibRaw\n\nThis library doesn't come with LibRaw included, you will have to install it by yourself.\n\nDepending on which distribution you are using, it might not be possible to decode RAW on modern camera (for instance Fuji X100T).\n\nI'm planning on shipping node-libraw with the latest version of libraw, but due to my meager knowledge of C++ it's going to take some time.\n\nAny contributions are, of course, welcome.\n\nOn linux: ```sudo apt-get install libraw-dev```\n\n## Known issues\n\n**OSX: libintl.h not found**\n\nInstall gettext via brew\n\n```\nbrew install gettext\n```\n\nCreate a symlink\n\n```\nln -s /usr/local/Cellar/gettext/[YOUR-VERSION]/lib/libintl.* /usr/local/include/\n```","starsCount":1,"created":"2016-02-08T14:37:25.818Z","modified":"2017-03-24T15:53:25.256Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"m0g","email":"nogues.loic@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"m0g","email":"nogues.loic@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"libraw","_nodeVersion":"6.9.5","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/libraw-0.1.4.tgz_1490370804460_0.5209385002963245"},"_npmUser":{"name":"m0g","email":"nogues.loic@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.10","_rev":"4-848aeef887aa285b85603544316adc4e","_shasum":"5616df665c492db43d9a94453529c36f8b753ae3","author":"","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/m0g/node-libraw/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"5616df665c492db43d9a94453529c36f8b753ae3","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/libraw/-/libraw-0.1.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"m0g","email":"nogues.loic@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-03-24T15:53:25.256Z","created":"2016-02-08T14:37:25.818Z","0.1.0":"2016-02-08T14:37:25.818Z","0.1.1":"2016-02-08T14:45:25.034Z","0.1.2":"2016-02-08T16:28:59.616Z","0.2.0":"2016-04-07T10:36:58.969Z","0.1.3":"2017-01-26T17:47:35.793Z","0.1.4":"2017-03-24T15:53:25.256Z"},"users":{"andr":true}}}
