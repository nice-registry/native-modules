You can utilize all feature characters of ES6 in the framework.\n\n## General Purpose\n\nOur general purpose is to code with a synchronized way but run in an asynchronous way  for the web project written Node.JS.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhipster/nhipster.github.io/master/images/easynode_dev_run.png\" width=\"800\"/>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n\n## Code Fragement\n\n### Class is the First-Citizen\n\nEasyNode follows the object oriented programming method. The first citizen is the class not the funciton.  all classes extend GenericObject. Below is the class template.\n\n```\nvar assert = require('assert');\nvar logger = using('easynode.framework.Logger').forFile(__filename);\nvar GenericObject = using('easynode.GenericObject');\n\n(function () {\n        /**\n         * Class ${NAME}\n         *\n         * @class #NAMESPACE#.${NAME}\n         * @extends easynode.GenericObject\n         * @since 0.1.0\n         * @author ${AUTHOR}\n         * */\n        class ${NAME} extends GenericObject {\n                /**\n                 * 构造函数。\n                 *\n                 * @method 构造函数\n                 * @since 0.1.0\n                 * @author ${AUTHOR}\n                 * */\n                constructor () {\n                        super();\n                        //调用super()后再定义子类成员。\n                }\n\n                getClassName () {\n                        return EasyNode.namespace(__filename);\n                }\n        }\n\n        module.exports = ${NAME};\n})();\n```\n\n## Namespace\n\nThe organization structure of this directory is as similar as to organize in the Java programming language that the directory path as the namespace of the class. You can declare a class and create a object like below:\n\n```\nvar Package = using('netease.smartwatch.backend.models.Package');\nvar model = new Package();\n```\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhipster/nhipster.github.io/master/images/directory_structure.png\" width=\"800\"/>\n<br>\n\n## How can you develop with easynode?\n\nWith the following references. you will're familiarize with the development process in easynode quickly.
