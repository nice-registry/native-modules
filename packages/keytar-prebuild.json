On macOS the passwords are managed by the Keychain, on Linux they are managed by the Secret Service API/libsecret, and on Windows they are managed by Credential Vault.\n\n## Installing\n\n```sh\nnpm install keytar\n```\n\n### On Linux\n\nCurrently this library uses `libsecret` so you may need to install it before `npm install`ing.\n\nDepending on your distribution, you will need to run the following command:\n\n* Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libsecret-1-dev`\n* Red Hat-based: `sudo yum install libsecret-devel`\n* Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S libsecret`\n\n## Building\n\n  * Clone the repository\n  * Run `npm install`\n  * Run `npm test` to run the tests\n\n## Docs\n\n```javascript\nconst keytar = require('keytar')\n```\n\nEvery function in keytar is asynchronous and returns a promise. The promise will be rejected with any error that occurs or will be resolved with the function's \"yields\" value.\n\n### getPassword(service, account)\n\nGet the stored password for the `service` and `account`.\n\n`service` - The string service name.\n\n`account` - The string account name.\n\nYields the string password or `null` if an entry for the given service and account was not found.\n\n### setPassword(service, account, password)\n\nSave the `password` for the `service` and `account` to the keychain. Adds a new entry if necessary, or updates an existing entry if one exists.\n\n`service` - The string service name.\n\n`account` - The string account name.\n\n`password` - The string password.\n\nYields nothing.\n\n### deletePassword(service, account)\n\nDelete the stored password for the `service` and `account`.\n\n`service` - The string service name.\n\n`account` - The string account name.\n\nYields `true` if a password was deleted, or `false` if an entry with the given service and account was not found.\n\n### findPassword(service)\n\nFind a password for the `service` in the keychain.\n\n`service` - The string service name.\n\nYields the string password, or `null` if an entry for the given service and account was not found.\n","created":"2017-07-03T11:31:11.276Z","modified":"2017-07-03T11:31:11.276Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"develar","email":"develar@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"develar","email":"develar@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"keytar-prebuild","_nodeVersion":"8.1.3","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/keytar-prebuild-4.0.3.tgz_1499081470340_0.0598623922560364"},"_npmUser":{"name":"develar","email":"develar@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"5.0.4","_rev":"1-42dd877ff3aeca86f723a4da9c6d4b19","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom/node-keytar/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"4.0.3"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-u1lNqXK2t6A1i0LD/+IqPTExYE/hwsXu9NJYnYZx+Z2spQGaj/qDQlFVa/LP1DX6lGQ81h6Z5Xom0Tzf050NNQ==","shasum":"1bcbe37c55b5b079e962e0546e528c13ea923295","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/keytar-prebuild/-/keytar-prebuild-4.0.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"develar","email":"develar@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-07-03T11:31:11.276Z","created":"2017-07-03T11:31:11.276Z","4.0.3":"2017-07-03T11:31:11.276Z"}}}
