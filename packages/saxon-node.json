The method names mirror http://www.saxonica.com/saxon-c/doc/html/index.html.\n\nNote: release v0.2.1 is linux and mac and pending windows version of Saxon/C 1.0.2\n\nNote: release v0.2.0 is linux only pending the release of mac and windows versions of Saxon/C 1.0.1\n\nNote: release v0.1.1 is built with nodejs v4.2.x [v4.2.x has Buffer acting like Uint8Array and currently is indistinguishable on the native side yet seems to work for this project]. If you want v0.12.x compatibility stay with v0.0.5. npm will continue with\nnodejs v4.2.x line and any fixes or features needed by prior versions will be from github branches.\n\nTo tell it where the Saxon/C is set the environment variable SAXONC_HOME to path:\n\n```bash\nexport SAXONC_HOME=/home/user/Software/Saxonica/Saxon-HEC1.0.2\n```\n\n####Prebuilts\n\n linux-x64,linux-ia32, darwin-x64 and win32-ia32(no saxon-c 1.0.2 yet).\n\n```bash\nnpm install --fallback-to-build\n```\nwill first try to find a compatible native prebuilt.  If it works you won't need development tools and compilers.\n\n####Building (only if needed; contact me if there is a particular prebuild you would use)\nIf a compatible prebuilt is not found, a number of environment variables are needed.\nFor the build phase, as with integrating Saxon/C interface code in c/c++ applications the jni.h is needed.  Set JAVA_HOME and the binding.gyp locates the jni.h from there. Only the headers are used; libsaxon.so that comes wth Saxon/C is loaded from it's home folder.\nThe libsaxon.so depends on $SAXONC_HOME/rt during runtime and it needs library paths $SAXONC_HOME:$SAXONC_HOME/rt/lib/amd64/jetvm:$SAXONC_HOME/rt/lib/amd64.  rt is the runtime <a href=\"http://www.excelsiorjet.com/\">http://www.excelsiorjet.com/</a> that Saxon/C provides.\nTo run it needs the harmony switch and at least nodejs v4.2.x. Make sure there isn't a java path to jvm in front of the Excelsior JET tool in rt folder:\n\n```bash\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SAXONC_HOME:$SAXONC_HOME/rt/lib/amd64/jetvm:$SAXONC_HOME/rt/lib/amd64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\nnode --harmony saxon-node.js /home/user/testing-grounds/BCL/analyze.xml /home/user/NetBeansProjects/OOBackbone/stylesheets/divconIsSpecies.xsl\n```\nYet this isn't the purpose to run xslt as this small app.  The intention is the calling of the API from your applications.\n\n####To test\n```bash\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SAXONC_HOME:$SAXONC_HOME/rt/lib/amd64/jetvm:$SAXONC_HOME/rt/lib/amd64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\nmocha --harmony --require should\n```\n\nDocumentation: <a href=\"http://rimmartin.github.io/saxon-node/\">Saxon Node API</a>\n\n","created":"2015-01-11T21:55:36.915Z","modified":"2016-09-03T21:40:24.782Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"rimmartin","email":"mathmldashx@yahoo.com"},"owners":[{"name":"rimmartin","email":"mathmldashx@yahoo.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"saxon-node","_nodeVersion":"6.2.2","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/saxon-node-0.2.1.tgz_1472938822514_0.09568381402641535"},"_npmUser":{"name":"rimmartin","email":"mathmldashx@yahoo.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.9.5","_rev":"1-efaf56f22ce814a233504da712100b87","_shasum":"e742bd059b4eb5e80987c25cc2588e417f6b4353","author":{"name":"roger","email":"mathmldashx@yahoo.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/rimmartin/saxon-node/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.2.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"e742bd059b4eb5e80987c25cc2588e417f6b4353","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/saxon-node/-/saxon-node-0.2.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"rimmartin","email":"mathmldashx@yahoo.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-09-03T21:40:24.782Z","created":"2015-01-11T21:55:36.915Z","0.0.1":"2015-01-11T21:55:36.915Z","0.0.2":"2015-02-01T19:39:24.435Z","0.0.3":"2015-02-08T16:54:10.915Z","0.0.4":"2015-08-03T15:06:02.075Z","0.0.5":"2015-08-05T16:14:27.138Z","0.1.0":"2015-10-15T11:42:36.299Z","0.1.1":"2015-11-02T14:22:06.865Z","0.2.0":"2016-04-10T05:52:08.968Z","0.2.1":"2016-09-03T21:40:24.782Z"}}}
