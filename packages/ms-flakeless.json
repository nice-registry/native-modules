This is useful when incrementing primary keys are either not available (ex: in Cassandra or Neo4j) or not feasible at your current scale.\n\n## How it Works\n\nThe strategy for generating IDs is identical to how Twitter generates IDs with [Snowflake](https://blog.twitter.com/2010/announcing-snowflake).  Flakeless is an implementation of their algorithm for Node.js.  The primary benefit of Flakeless over the other Javascript implementations is that Flakeless was written as a native addon, so it has the ease of use of any other Javascript library but has the performance of C++.\n\nThe way Snowflake (and by proxy, Flakeless) works is by combining the following values:\n\n* The time difference between the current time and the starting epoch in milliseconds. This accounts for the most significant 41 bits.\n\n* A number signifying the computer generating the ID. This is the middle 10 bits, and is entirely arbitrary and is assigned by the user.\n\n* A counter denoting how many other IDs have been generated in this millisecond. This accounts for the least significant 12 bits.\n\n## Installing\n\nBefore you install Flakeless, you first need to make sure that `node-gyp` is installed. Because Flakeless is written primarily in C++, it first needs to be compiled.\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g node-gyp\n```\n\nOnce `node-gyp` is installed, install Flakeless.\n\n```bash\nnpm install flakeless\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Initialization:\n\n```js\nconst Flakeless = require('flakeless').Flakeless;\nconst flakeless = new Flakeless({\n  epochStart: Date.now(),\n  outputType: 'base64',\n  workerID: 71\n});\n```\n\n`epochStart` is a number representing the start of the time period in milliseconds used to generate IDs. IDs will potentially begin repeating approximately 69 years after this date. This defaults to the beginning of the Unix epoch.\n\n`outputType` is a string representing which alphabet to use when returning the ID. The options are `base10` (using characters 0-9), `base16` (using characters 0-9 and A-F), and `base64` (using characters -, 0-9, A-Z, _, and a-z). Regardless of which format is specified, the output will always be a string. This defaults to `base64`.\n\n`workerID` is an arbitrary identifier signifying the computer generating the IDs. This allows multiple computers to generate IDs without every needing to communicate state. The range for this is from 0 to 1023, and it defaults to 0 if not provided.\n\n### Generating an ID:\n\n```js\nlet id = flakeless.next();\n```\n\n`Flakeless#next` takes no arguments, and returns a string containing the next unique ID. Strings were used because Flakeless generates 63-bit IDs, and Javascript only supports up to 52-bit integers before precision declines.\n\n### Using the built-in Client and Server:\n\n```js\nconst Flakeless = require('flakeless').Flakeless;\nconst Client = require('flakeless').Client;\nconst Server = require('flakeless').Server;\n\nconst flakeless = new Flakeless;\nconst server = new Server(6000, function() {\n  server.addGenerator('/a', flakeless);\n});\n\nconst client = new Client('http://localhost:6000/a')\nclient.next().then(function(ids) {\n  // use the IDs here\n});\n```\n\n## Performance\n\nPreliminary benchmarks yield the following results:\n\n| Flakeless        | Flakeless JS     | `node-snowflake` | `Date.now()`     |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| 0.000099 ms/call | 0.003470 ms/call | 0.003870 ms/call | 0.000069 ms/call |\n|   10101 calls/ms |     288 calls/ms |     258 calls/ms |   14492 calls/ms |\n\n_\\* All tests done by measuring the average time per call over 10,000,000 calls while outputting to base64, except for `node-snowflake` which only outputs decimal values and `Date.now()` which was used as a reference._\n\n## Roadmap\n\n* Soon Flakeless will support providing custom times to `Flakeless#next` instead of using the current system clock in milliseconds.\n* Eventually, Flakeless will support custom output formats that deviate from the provided 41-10-12 format, and will allow for the utilization of MAC addresses.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you think you can add useful features to Flakeless or can make it faster, please contribute! Most of the work here was done in a handful of days while learning how to use V8 and NAN, so there's definitely a lot of room for improvement.\n","created":"2016-08-14T18:20:42.008Z","modified":"2016-08-17T12:50:39.088Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"avvs","email":"v@aminev.me"},"owners":[{"name":"avvs","email":"v@aminev.me"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"ms-flakeless","_nodeVersion":"6.3.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/ms-flakeless-4.0.1.tgz_1471438238391_0.24147883709520102"},"_npmUser":{"name":"avvs","email":"v@aminev.me"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.5","_rev":"1-8f9cb6ff5b94a83d31dd823cb4b17ca8","_shasum":"697c42642fb29e5f6873de7c6dd024cc6eeab83c","author":{"name":"Anthony Salani","url":"https://github.com/asalani93"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/makeomatic/node-flakeless/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"4.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"697c42642fb29e5f6873de7c6dd024cc6eeab83c","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/ms-flakeless/-/ms-flakeless-4.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"avvs","email":"v@aminev.me"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-08-17T12:50:39.088Z","created":"2016-08-14T18:20:42.008Z","3.0.0":"2016-08-14T18:20:42.008Z","3.0.1":"2016-08-14T18:22:51.003Z","4.0.0":"2016-08-16T17:57:08.052Z","4.0.1":"2016-08-17T12:50:39.088Z"}}}
