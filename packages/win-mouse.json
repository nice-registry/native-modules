Receive the screen position of various mouse events. The events are also emitted while another application is in the foreground.\n\nTested in Windows Vista with node versions `0.10` and `0.12`, and latest `iojs`.\n\n\tnpm install win-mouse\n\n# Usage\n\nThe module returns an event emitter instance.\n\n```javascript\nvar mouse = require('win-mouse')();\n\nmouse.on('move', function(x, y) {\n\tconsole.log(x, y);\n});\n```\n\nThe program will not terminate as long as a mouse listener is active. To allow the program to exit, either call `mouse.unref` (works as `unref`/`ref` on a TCP server) or `mouse.destroy()`.\n\nThe events emitted are: `move`, `left-down`, `left-up`, `left-drag`, `right-up`, `right-down` and `right-drag`. For each event the screen coordinates are passed to the handler function.\n","created":"2015-05-16T08:52:08.211Z","modified":"2017-07-25T14:29:38.605Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"kapetan","email":"mirza.kapetanovic@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"kapetan","email":"mirza.kapetanovic@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"win-mouse","_nodeVersion":"4.2.6","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/win-mouse-1.1.2.tgz_1500992977623_0.9958495874889195"},"_npmUser":{"name":"kapetan","email":"mirza.kapetanovic@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.12","_rev":"2-3a547e529163acd523a8c739cf94ed83","_shasum":"f83e38be7e7e2e9e7a286156e2767060f93125bd","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/kapetan/win-mouse/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.1.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"f83e38be7e7e2e9e7a286156e2767060f93125bd","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/win-mouse/-/win-mouse-1.1.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"kapetan","email":"mirza.kapetanovic@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-07-25T14:29:38.605Z","created":"2015-05-16T08:52:08.211Z","1.0.0":"2015-05-16T08:52:08.211Z","1.0.1":"2015-05-16T15:09:20.481Z","1.0.2":"2015-05-21T19:47:43.120Z","1.0.3":"2015-09-17T19:58:34.483Z","1.1.0":"2016-01-26T09:23:20.363Z","1.1.1":"2016-04-20T08:57:26.667Z","1.1.2":"2017-07-25T14:29:38.605Z"}}}
