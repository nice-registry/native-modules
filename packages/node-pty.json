This allows you to fork processes with pseudoterminal file descriptors. It returns a terminal object which allows reads and writes.\n\nThis is useful for:\n\n- Writing a terminal emulator (eg. via [xterm.js](https://github.com/sourcelair/xterm.js)).\n- Getting certain programs to *think* you're a terminal, such as when you need a program to send you control sequences.\n\n`node-pty` supports Linux, macOS and Windows. Windows support is possible by utilizing the [winpty](https://github.com/rprichard/winpty) library.\n\n## Real-world Uses\n\n`node-pty` powers many different terminal emulators, including:\n\n- [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](code.visualstudio.com)\n- [Hyper](https://hyper.is/)\n- [Upterm](https://github.com/railsware/upterm)\n- [Script Runner](https://github.com/ioquatix/script-runner) for Atom.\n\nDo you use node-pty in your application as well? Please open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Tyriar/node-pty/pulls) to include it here. We would love to have it in our list.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```js\nvar os = require('os');\nvar pty = require('node-pty');\n\nvar shell = os.platform() === 'win32' ? 'powershell.exe' : 'bash';\n\nvar ptyProcess = pty.spawn(shell, [], {\n  name: 'xterm-color',\n  cols: 80,\n  rows: 30,\n  cwd: process.env.HOME,\n  env: process.env\n});\n\nptyProcess.on('data', function(data) {\n  console.log(data);\n});\n\nptyProcess.write('ls\\r');\nptyProcess.resize(100, 40);\nptyProcess.write('ls\\r');\n```\n\n## Building\n\n```bash\n# Install dependencies and build C++\nnpm install\n# Compile TypeScript -> JavaScript\nnpm run tsc\n```\n\n## Debugging\n\nOn Windows, you can show the winpty agent console window by adding the environment variable `WINPTY_SHOW_CONSOLE=1` to the pty's environment. See https://github.com/rprichard/winpty#debugging-winpty for more information.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Powershell gives error 8009001d**\n\n> Internal Windows PowerShell error.  Loading managed Windows PowerShell failed with error 8009001d.\n\nThis happens when PowerShell is launched with no `SystemRoot` environment variable present.\n\n## pty.js\n\nThis project is forked from [chjj/pty.js](https://github.com/chjj/pty.js) with the primary goals being to provide better support for later Node.JS versions and Windows.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2012-2015, Christopher Jeffrey (MIT License).  \nCopyright (c) 2016, Daniel Imms (MIT License).\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2017-01-07T05:59:41.623Z","modified":"2017-08-21T17:23:32.052Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"tyriar","email":"tyriar@tyriar.com"},"owners":[{"name":"tyriar","email":"tyriar@tyriar.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"node-pty","_nodeVersion":"6.2.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/node-pty-0.7.0.tgz_1503336211915_0.7109534835908562"},"_npmUser":{"name":"tyriar","email":"tyriar@tyriar.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.9.3","_rev":"31-f373b1c50f445dfda8792bc25fc3732e","_shasum":"993038692d3a2921811a152658fc7dc211323ac2","author":{"name":"Daniel Imms"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/Tyriar/node-pty/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.7.0","beta":"0.6.5-beta1"},"dist":{"shasum":"993038692d3a2921811a152658fc7dc211323ac2","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/node-pty/-/node-pty-0.7.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"tyriar","email":"tyriar@tyriar.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-08-21T17:23:32.052Z","created":"2017-01-07T05:59:41.623Z","0.0.1":"2017-01-07T05:59:41.623Z","0.1.0":"2017-01-07T06:36:54.773Z","0.4.0":"2017-01-07T06:39:15.194Z","0.4.1":"2017-01-07T06:52:55.666Z","0.5.0":"2017-01-08T10:09:25.120Z","0.5.0-beta":"2017-01-08T10:16:07.951Z","0.5.0-beta2":"2017-01-08T10:25:21.858Z","0.5.0-beta3":"2017-01-08T10:29:39.498Z","0.5.0-beta4":"2017-01-08T11:32:08.713Z","0.5.0-beta5":"2017-01-16T04:41:32.557Z","0.5.1":"2017-01-16T04:56:12.154Z","0.6.0-beta1":"2017-01-16T04:59:11.720Z","0.6.0-beta2":"2017-01-16T05:11:37.583Z","0.6.0-beta3":"2017-01-18T16:51:07.696Z","0.6.0":"2017-01-20T04:25:54.998Z","0.6.1":"2017-01-21T22:19:02.189Z","0.6.2-beta1":"2017-01-21T23:48:13.884Z","0.6.2":"2017-01-22T07:47:58.643Z","0.6.3-beta1":"2017-03-13T20:58:03.521Z","0.6.3":"2017-03-13T21:20:06.885Z","0.6.4":"2017-04-23T18:23:59.252Z","0.6.5-beta1":"2017-05-17T17:04:24.210Z","0.6.5":"2017-05-17T17:47:21.775Z","0.6.6":"2017-05-22T03:11:19.845Z","0.6.7":"2017-06-12T21:24:17.257Z","0.6.8":"2017-06-12T21:28:05.925Z","0.6.9":"2017-07-10T00:05:26.603Z","0.6.10":"2017-07-12T19:51:56.013Z","0.7.0":"2017-08-21T17:23:32.052Z"},"users":{"jrop":true}}}
