It will prompt for the device's PIN code when needed.  To run:\n```sh\n$ hap-client-tool [tool args] pair\n```\n\nOn success, \"pairing complete\" will be printed to the console.  On failure, the error will be printed.\n\n\n### `dump`\n\n`dump` connects to an already-paired HomeKit device and dumps a list of all of the accessories, services, and characteristics published by the device in JSON format.  Its primary use is to determine what data is exposed by the device and which accessory and instance IDs correspond to each property.  The data from the device itself will be augmented with any available metadata for known service or characteristic types.  To run:\n\n```sh\n$ hap-client-tool [tool args] dump\n```\n\nWhich might dump something like this:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"accessories\": [\n        {\n            \"aid\": 1,\n            \"services\": [\n                {\n                    \"iid\": 7,\n                    \"type\": \"00000040-0000-1000-8000-0026BB765291\",\n                    \"characteristics\": [\n                        {\n                            \"iid\": 9,\n                            \"type\": \"00000025-0000-1000-8000-0026BB765291\",\n                            \"perms\": [\n                                \"pr\",\n                                \"pw\",\n                                \"ev\"\n                            ],\n                            \"format\": \"bool\",\n                            \"value\": false,\n                            \"description\": \"On\",\n                            \"Format\": \"bool\",\n                            \"Properties\": [\n                                \"read\",\n                                \"write\",\n                                \"cnotify\"\n                            ],\n                            \"Name\": \"On\",\n                            \"Permissions\": [\n                                \"securedRead\",\n                                \"securedWrite\"\n                            ]\n                        }\n                    ],\n                    \"OptionalCharacteristics\": [\n                        \"00000028-0000-1000-8000-0026BB765291\",\n                        \"00000029-0000-1000-8000-0026BB765291\",\n                        \"00000023-0000-1000-8000-0026BB765291\"\n                    ],\n                    \"RequiredCharacteristics\": [\n                        \"00000025-0000-1000-8000-0026BB765291\"\n                    ],\n                    \"Name\": \"Fan\"\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### `get`\n\n`get` connects to a paired HomeKit device and fetches the current value of the specified characteristic.  To run:\n\n```sh\n$ hap-client-tool [tool args] get --aid <m> --iid <n>\n\n# for example, for a boolean property:\n$ hap-client-tool [tool args] get --aid 1 --iid 11\ntrue\n$ \n```\n\nOn success, the value (with no formatting) is printed to the console.  On failure, the error is printed.\n\n### `set`\n\n`set` connects to a paired HomeKit device and sets the value of the specified characteristic.  To run:\n\n```sh\n$ hap-client-tool [tool args] set --aid <m> --iid <n> [value]\n\n# for example, for a boolean property:\n$ hap-client-tool [tool args] set --aid 1 --iid 11 true\n$ \n```\n\nOn success, the tool will exit without printing anything..  On failure, the error is printed.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are of course always welcome.
