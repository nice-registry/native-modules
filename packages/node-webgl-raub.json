However, it is now quite different and support different platform \nbindings, mainly GLFW instead of SDL.\n\nDependencies\n============\n- node-glfw, which depends on GLEW, GLFW as well as AntTweakBar. See node-glfw for installation instructions.\n- freeimage is used to load/save a variety of image formats.\n- node-gyp if not already available in your distribution\n\nInstallation\n============\n`npm install node-webgl`\n\n###Installation Notes for Windows 7\nBeware of the Node.JS distribution you use. The default Node.JS is 32-bit and this means that modules \nwill be compiled by node-gyp with 32-bit settings, which often leads to compilation errors especially\non 64-bit systems.\n\nSo for Windows 7 64-bit, instead of downloading the default Node.JS windows installer, select 'Other release files'.\nThis will show you an ftp site for the latest release. Go into x64 folder and download that distribution.\n\n###Installation Notes for OSX\n`brew install anttweakbar freeimage`\n\nUsage\n=====\nexamples/   contains examples from other the web\ntest/       contains lessons from www.learningwebgl.com and other tests\n\nsimply type: node test/lesson02.js\n\nEnjoy!\n\nLimitations\n===========\nWebGL is based on OpenGL ES, a restriction of OpenGL found on desktops, for embedded systems.\nBecause this module wraps OpenGL, it is possible to do things that may not work on web browsers. \nPlease read http://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki_1_15/index.php/WebGL_and_OpenGL_Differences \nto learn about the differences.\n\n- shaders\nRemember to add this on top of your fragment shaders:\n<pre>\n#ifdef GL_ES\nprecision highp float;\n#endif\n</pre>\n\n- loading external scripts\nIf your code uses external libraries, you can load them like this. No code change to external scripts ;-)\n<pre>\nfs=require('fs');\neval(fs.readFileSync(__dirname+ '/glMatrix-0.9.5.min.js','utf8'));\n</pre>\n\n- frame rate\nrequestAnimationFrame(callback [, delay]) works as in the browser. \nIf delay is specified, it is the requested delay in milliseconds between animation frames \ne.g. 16 will provide 1000 / 16 = 62 fps at best, which is the default value if delay is undefined. \nIf delay = 0, then the fastest possible framerate on your machine is used.\n\nThe timestamp now uses the high-resolution timer in your machine (not new Date()). This provides a much more precise\nframerate as well as much better timing for animations.\n","created":"2017-01-23T06:48:29.729Z","modified":"2017-08-23T14:45:22.788Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"raub","email":"raubtierxxx@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"raub","email":"raubtierxxx@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"node-webgl-raub","_nodeVersion":"8.1.3","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/node-webgl-raub-0.7.4.tgz_1503499521605_0.5021547642536461"},"_npmUser":{"name":"raub","email":"raubtierxxx@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.6.1","_rev":"20-927ee29dc257c38e3e756c6e6cc5d02d","_shasum":"c84c9e2e510b67cf772d2a64948fbd1ed2071adc","author":{"name":"Luis Blanco","email":"raubtierxxx@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/raub/node-webgl/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.7.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"c84c9e2e510b67cf772d2a64948fbd1ed2071adc","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/node-webgl-raub/-/node-webgl-raub-0.7.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"raub","email":"raubtierxxx@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-08-23T14:45:22.788Z","created":"2017-01-23T06:48:29.729Z","0.5.5":"2017-01-23T06:48:29.729Z","0.5.6":"2017-01-23T07:26:01.179Z","0.5.7":"2017-01-23T18:49:03.155Z","0.5.8":"2017-01-27T13:49:36.312Z","0.5.9":"2017-01-28T10:14:45.507Z","0.6.0":"2017-01-28T12:00:29.001Z","0.6.1":"2017-02-15T15:05:35.923Z","0.6.2":"2017-02-18T21:32:13.783Z","0.6.3":"2017-02-20T19:06:48.818Z","0.6.4":"2017-02-23T07:24:17.187Z","0.6.5":"2017-02-23T07:49:43.850Z","0.6.6":"2017-02-23T07:53:30.657Z","0.6.7":"2017-05-27T15:00:02.443Z","0.6.8":"2017-07-31T14:56:00.340Z","0.6.9":"2017-07-31T20:28:05.176Z","0.7.0":"2017-08-01T19:23:07.028Z","0.7.1":"2017-08-03T09:08:17.970Z","0.7.2":"2017-08-23T06:45:58.033Z","0.7.3":"2017-08-23T14:12:08.677Z","0.7.4":"2017-08-23T14:45:22.788Z"}}}
