[As it has been found](http://newtontalk.newtontalk.narkive.com/U6dNGqJw/newton-dock-password), Newton OS has it's own implementation of DES encryption, so any try to implement Dock password exchange using standard DES will fail.\n\nThis module uses a C++ implementation from Paul Guyot ( [Kallisys](http://www.kallisys.com) )  with small modifications in order to compile a node native addon.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n$ npm install --save newton-des-crypto\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nNewtonDesCrypto = require('newton-des-crypto');\npwd = \"apassword\";\ndataEncrypted = NewtonDesCrypto.encryptBlock(pwd, '00783C8C002BB602'); \ndecryptedData = NewtonDesCrypto.decryptBlock(pwd, dataEncrypted);\n```\n\n## Tests\n\nUnit test available via:\n```\n$ grunt test\n```\n\n## License\n\nPortions of C++ code for Int64 manipulation, UniCode Strings, and DES Encryption created by original author are Copyright (C) 2001-2004, Paul Guyot.
