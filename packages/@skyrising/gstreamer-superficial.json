It does not attempt at being a complete binding, and will hopefully one day be replaced by (or implemented with) node-gir.\n\n## How?\n\n```javascript\nconst gstreamer = require('gstreamer-superficial');\nconst pipeline = new gstreamer.Pipeline(`videotestsrc ! textoverlay name=text\n\t! autovideosink`);\n\t\npipeline.play();\n```\n\nThen, you can find an element within the pipeline, and set its properties:\n\n```javascript\nconst target = pipeline.findChild('text');\n\ntarget.text = 'Hello';\nObject.assign(target.text, {\n\ttext: 'Hello', \n\t'font-desc': 'Helvetica 32',\n})\n```\n\n(see also _examples/basic-pipeline.js_)\n\nPipeline also knows `.stop()`, `.pause()` and `.pollBus()`,\nthe elements returned by `.findChild()` getting and setting all properties the real [`GObject`](https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/gobject-The-Base-Object-Type.html)s do, appsinks also support `.pull()` (see below). \n\n\n### Polling the GStreamer Pipeline Bus\n\nYou can asynchronously handle bus messages using Pipeline.pollBus(callback):\n\n```javascript\npipeline.pollBus(msg => {\n\tconsole.log(msg);\n});\n```\n\n(see also _examples/bus.js_)\n\n\n### Handling binary data\n\nYou can feast off GStreamer's appsink to handle binary data.\n.pull starts a background work queue and calls your callback whenever a buffer is (or caps are) available:\n\n```javascript\nconst appsink = pipeline.findChild('sink');\n\nfunction onData(buf) {\n\tconsole.log('BUFFER size', buf.length);\n\tappsink.pull(onData);\n}\n\nappsink.pull(onData, caps => {\n\t/* caps currently not implemented */\n\tconsole.log('CAPS', caps);\n});\n```\n\n(see _examples/appsink.js_)\n\n\n### A simple Ogg/Theora streaming server\n\nis broken, but was once working as implemented in _examples/streaming/_  \nrun server.js (requires express) and point your browser to http://localhost:8001. (Tested only with Chromium).\nThis handles retaining the streamheader to feed first to every newly connected client.\n\n\n## Who?\n\ngstreamer-superficial was written by Daniel Turing (mail AT danielturing.com) and currently licensed under the GPLv3.
