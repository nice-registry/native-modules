Simply supply a callback function as the last\nargument to turn the call asynchronous.  \nA callback function is *required* if a host other than the localhost is to be\nqueried.  \n\n**Note:** In some environments, the synchronous functions may throw an `Error` of\n`\"access is denied to current user\"`, and any of the asynchronous functions may\npass this error to the callback. This would be a consequence of the user's\npermissions versus the particular security configuration of the domain.\n\n---\n## API\n\n### localgroups.list()\n*Synchronous.* Returns a list of all local groups defined on the local system.\n- Return: {Array} array of objects, each with two properties:  \n  * **name** {String} Name of local group\n  * **comment** {String | `null`} Descriptive comment\n\n### localgroups.list([hostname,] callback)\n*Asynchronous.* Passes a list of all local groups defined on the local system\n(or, optionally, on the system named by `hostname`) to the `callback` function.\nIf `hostname` is given and it is unknown or cannot be accessed, an `Error` is\npassed back.\n- `hostname` {String} *Optional.*  \n  The name of a host in the domain to query.
