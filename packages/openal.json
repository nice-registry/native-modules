(OSX Lion)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10536001/my-openal-framework-is-broken-how-can-i-fix-it-osx-lion)\n\n### Testing\nAs a newcomer to node addons, rather than setting up the whole Eclipse-based debugging environment, I found it helpful to compile my addon in debug mode and just run node through gdb:\n\n\tnode-gyp clean && node-gyp configure && node-gyp build --debug\n\tgdb node\n\t(gdb) set args test/stream.js\n\t(gdb) run\n\nEven though node isn't compiled with debug symbols, this got me close enough to the problem when I was getting weird segfaults.\n\n### To do\n* Use [libuv](https://github.com/joyent/libuv) for stream reading?\n* [OpenAL-soft](http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html) air absorption, occlusion, and environmental reverb\n* same as [EFX](http://connect.creativelabs.com/developer/Wiki/Introduction%20to%20EFX.aspx)?\n* [use MPlayer for compressed formats?](http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal-tutorial.html) or [ogg](http://devmaster.net/posts/2895/openal-lesson-8-oggvorbis-streaming-using-the-source-queue)\n* ultimately, I want to be able to stream the audio that is generated.
