Control the mouse, keyboard, and read the screen.\n\nRobotJS supports Mac, [Windows](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/issues/2), and [Linux](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/issues/17).\n\nThis is a work in progress so the exported functions could change at any time before the first stable release (1.0.0).

Instructions for [Electron](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/wiki/Electron).\n\n## Examples\n\n##### [Mouse](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/wiki/Syntax#mouse)\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://cldup.com/lugVjjAkEi.gif\"></p>\n\n```JavaScript\n// Move the mouse across the screen as a sine wave.\nvar robot = require(\"robotjs\");\n\n// Speed up the mouse.\nrobot.setMouseDelay(2);\n\nvar twoPI = Math.PI * 2.0;\nvar screenSize = robot.getScreenSize();\nvar height = (screenSize.height / 2) - 10;\nvar width = screenSize.width;\n\nfor (var x = 0; x < width; x++)\n{\n\ty = height * Math.sin((twoPI * x) / width) + height;\n\trobot.moveMouse(x, y);\n}\n```\n\n##### [Keyboard](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/wiki/Syntax#keyboard)\n\n```JavaScript\n// Type \"Hello World\" then press enter.\nvar robot = require(\"robotjs\");\n\n// Type \"Hello World\".\nrobot.typeString(\"Hello World\");\n\n// Press enter.\nrobot.keyTap(\"enter\");\n```\n\n##### [Screen](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/wiki/Syntax#screen)\n\n```JavaScript\n// Get pixel color under the mouse.\nvar robot = require(\"robotjs\");\n\n// Get mouse position.\nvar mouse = robot.getMousePos();\n\n// Get pixel color in hex format.\nvar hex = robot.getPixelColor(mouse.x, mouse.y);\nconsole.log(\"#\" + hex + \" at x:\" + mouse.x + \" y:\" + mouse.y);\n```\nRead the [Wiki](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/wiki) for more information!\n\n## [API](http://robotjs.io/docs/syntax)\n\nThe RobotJS API is hosted at <https://robotjs.io/docs/syntax>.\n\n## Building\n\nPlease ensure you have the required dependencies before installing:\n\n* Windows\n  * Visual Studio 2013 (Express works fine).\n  * Python (v2.7.3 recommended, v3.x.x is not supported).\n* Mac\n  * Xcode Command Line Tools.\n* Linux\n  * Python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x is not supported).\n  * make.\n  * A C/C++ compiler like GCC.\n  * libxtst-dev and libpng++-dev (`sudo apt-get install libxtst-dev libpng++-dev`).\n\nInstall node-gyp using npm:\n\n```\nnpm install -g node-gyp\n```\n\nThen build:\n\n```\nnode-gyp rebuild\n```\n\nSee the [node-gyp readme](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) for more details.\n\n## Plans\n\n* √ Control the mouse by changing the mouse position, left/right clicking, and dragging.\n* √ Control the keyboard by pressing keys, holding keys down, and typing words.\n* √ Read pixel color from the screen and capture the screen.\n* Find an image on screen, read pixels from an image.\n* Possibly include window management?\n\n## Progress\n\n| Module        | Status        | Notes   |\n| ------------- |-------------: | ------- |\n| Mouse         | 100%           | All planned features implemented.       |\n| Keyboard      | 100%           | All planned features implemented.       |\n| Screen        | 85%            | Image search, pixel search. |\n| Bitmap        | 0%             |  Saving/opening, png support.  |\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Does RobotJS support global hotkeys? \n\nNot currently, and I don't know if it ever will. I personally use [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)/[NW.js](http://nwjs.io/) for global hotkeys, and this works well. Later on I might add hotkey support or create a separate module. See [#55](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/issues/55) for details. \n\n#### Can I take a screenshot with RobotJS? \n\nSoon! This is a bit more complicated than the rest of the features, so I saved it for last. Luckily the code is already there, I just need to write the bindings, and I've already started. Subscribe to [#13](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/issues/13) for updates. \n\n#### Why is &#60;insert key&#62; missing from the keyboard functions? \n\nWe've been implementing keys as we need them. Feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request!\n\n#### How about multi-monitor support?\n\nThe library doesn't have explicit multi-monitor support, so anything that works is kind of on accident. Subscribe to [#88](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/issues/88) for updates.\n\nFor any other questions please [submit an issue](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/issues/new).\n\n## Story\n\nI'm a huge fan of [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/), and I've used it for a very long time. AutoHotkey is great for automation and it can do a bunch of things that are very difficult in other languages. For example, it's [imagesearch](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/ImageSearch.htm) and [pixel](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/PixelGetColor.htm) related functions are hard to reproduce on Mac, especially in scripting languages. These functions are great for automating apps that can't be automated like [Netflix](http://blueshirtdesign.com/apps/autoflix/). This has never been a big deal since I've always used Windows at work, but for the past few years I've been using Mac exclusively. \n\nI like AutoHotkey, but I like Node.js more. By developing RobotJS I get an AutoHotkey replacement on Mac (finally!), and I get to use my favorite language. \n\n**TLDR:** There's nothing like AutoHotkey on Mac, so I'm making it. \n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\nBased on [autopy](https://github.com/msanders/autopy). \nMaintained by [Jason Stallings](http://jason.stallin.gs).\n","created":"2017-06-05T16:53:05.982Z","modified":"2017-06-21T15:34:44.497Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"prezjordan","email":"scalesjordan@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"prezjordan","email":"scalesjordan@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"robotjs-shade","_nodeVersion":"7.9.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/robotjs-shade-0.4.14.tgz_1498059283217_0.9278606490697712"},"_npmUser":{"name":"prezjordan","email":"scalesjordan@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.2.0","_rev":"8-ab30c2fd346b931b5e982e3b00952acc","_shasum":"11b1d8242bb8a60e0d2b26e446058bdd41a70967","author":{"name":"Jason Stallings"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.4.14"},"dist":{"shasum":"11b1d8242bb8a60e0d2b26e446058bdd41a70967","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/robotjs-shade/-/robotjs-shade-0.4.14.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"prezjordan","email":"scalesjordan@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-06-21T15:34:44.497Z","created":"2017-06-05T16:53:05.982Z","0.4.7":"2017-06-05T16:53:05.982Z","0.4.8":"2017-06-05T17:50:35.418Z","0.4.9":"2017-06-20T22:02:28.040Z","0.4.10":"2017-06-21T14:55:15.140Z","0.4.11":"2017-06-21T15:20:23.988Z","0.4.12":"2017-06-21T15:26:55.429Z","0.4.13":"2017-06-21T15:32:46.762Z","0.4.14":"2017-06-21T15:34:44.497Z"}}}
