After successful execution, every object will have two additional fields: `x` and `y`.\r\n\r\n\r\n`solve(options, rects, cb);`\r\n\r\nPack rectangles and return new array in callback. Same as `solveSync`, but works asynchronously, and return an array of objects with two fields: `x` and `y`.\r\n\r\n\r\n`options`\r\n\r\n- `w` - width of bin (required)\r\n- `h` - height of bin (required)\r\n- `alg` - type of algorithm (default BestAreaFit):\r\n  - BestShortSideFit or BSSF\r\n  - BestLongSideFit or BLSF\r\n  - BestAreaFit or BAF\r\n  - BottomLeftRule or BL\r\n  - ContactPointRule or CP\r\n\r\n\r\n## LICENSE\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2016 Vladimir Gamalian\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
