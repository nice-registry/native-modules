__Cairo__. For system-specific installation view the [Wiki](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/wiki/_pages).\n\nYou can quickly install the dependencies by using the command for your OS:\n\nOS | Command\n----- | -----\nOS X | `brew install pkg-config cairo libpng jpeg giflib`\nUbuntu | `sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev libjpeg8-dev libpango1.0-dev libgif-dev build-essential g++`\nFedora | `sudo yum install cairo cairo-devel cairomm-devel libjpeg-turbo-devel pango pango-devel pangomm pangomm-devel giflib-devel`\nSolaris | `pkgin install cairo pkg-config xproto renderproto kbproto xextproto`\nWindows | [Instructions on our wiki](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/wiki/Installation---Windows)\n\n**El Capitan users:** If you have recently updated to El Capitan and are experiencing trouble when compiling, run the following command: `xcode-select --install`. Read more about the problem [on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/32929012/148072).\n\n## Screencasts\n\n  - [Introduction](http://screenr.com/CTk)\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\nvar Canvas = require('canvas')\n  , Image = Canvas.Image\n  , canvas = new Canvas(200, 200)\n  , ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');\n\nctx.font = '30px Impact';\nctx.rotate(.1);\nctx.fillText(\"Awesome!\", 50, 100);\n\nvar te = ctx.measureText('Awesome!');\nctx.strokeStyle = 'rgba(0,0,0,0.5)';\nctx.beginPath();\nctx.lineTo(50, 102);\nctx.lineTo(50 + te.width, 102);\nctx.stroke();\n\nconsole.log('<img src=\"' + canvas.toDataURL() + '\" />');\n```\n\n## Non-Standard API\n\n node-canvas extends the canvas API to provide interfacing with node, for example streaming PNG data, converting to a `Buffer` instance, etc. Among the interfacing API, in some cases the drawing API has been extended for SSJS image manipulation / creation usage, however keep in mind these additions may fail to render properly within browsers.\n\n### Image#src=Buffer\n\n node-canvas adds `Image#src=Buffer` support, allowing you to read images from disc, redis, etc and apply them via `ctx.drawImage()`. Below we draw scaled down squid png by reading it from the disk with node's I/O.\n\n```javascript\nfs.readFile(__dirname + '/images/squid.png', function(err, squid){\n  if (err) throw err;\n  img = new Image;\n  img.src = squid;\n  ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0, img.width / 4, img.height / 4);\n});\n```\n\n Below is an example of a canvas drawing it-self as the source several time:\n\n```javascript\nvar img = new Image;\nimg.src = canvas.toBuffer();\nctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0, 50, 50);\nctx.drawImage(img, 50, 0, 50, 50);\nctx.drawImage(img, 100, 0, 50, 50);\n```\n\n### Image#dataMode\n\nnode-canvas adds `Image#dataMode` support, which can be used to opt-in to mime data tracking of images (currently only JPEGs).\n\nWhen mime data is tracked, in PDF mode JPEGs can be embedded directly into the output, rather than being re-encoded into PNG. This can drastically reduce filesize, and speed up rendering.\n\n```javascript\nvar img = new Image;\nimg.dataMode = Image.MODE_IMAGE; // Only image data tracked\nimg.dataMode = Image.MODE_MIME; // Only mime data tracked\nimg.dataMode = Image.MODE_MIME | Image.MODE_IMAGE; // Both are tracked\n```\n\nIf image data is not tracked, and the Image is drawn to an image rather than a PDF canvas, the output will be junk. Enabling mime data tracking has no benefits (only a slow down) unless you are generating a PDF.\n\n### Canvas#pngStream()\n\n  To create a `PNGStream` simply call `canvas.pngStream()`, and the stream will start to emit _data_ events, finally emitting _end_ when finished. If an exception occurs the _error_ event is emitted.\n\n```javascript\nvar fs = require('fs')\n  , out = fs.createWriteStream(__dirname + '/text.png')\n  , stream = canvas.pngStream();\n\nstream.on('data', function(chunk){\n  out.write(chunk);\n});\n\nstream.on('end', function(){\n  console.log('saved png');\n});\n```\n\nCurrently _only_ sync streaming is supported, however we plan on supporting async streaming as well (of course :) ). Until then the `Canvas#toBuffer(callback)` alternative is async utilizing `eio_custom()`.\n\n### Canvas#jpegStream() and Canvas#syncJPEGStream()\n\nYou can likewise create a `JPEGStream` by calling `canvas.jpegStream()` with\nsome optional parameters; functionality is otherwise identical to\n`pngStream()`. See `examples/crop.js` for an example.\n\n_Note: At the moment, `jpegStream()` is the same as `syncJPEGStream()`, both\nare synchronous_\n\n```javascript\nvar stream = canvas.jpegStream({\n    bufsize: 4096 // output buffer size in bytes, default: 4096\n  , quality: 75 // JPEG quality (0-100) default: 75\n  , progressive: false // true for progressive compression, default: false\n});\n```\n\n### Canvas#toBuffer()\n\nA call to `Canvas#toBuffer()` will return a node `Buffer` instance containing image data.\n\n```javascript\n// PNG Buffer, default settings\nvar buf = canvas.toBuffer();\n\n// PNG Buffer, zlib compression level 3 (from 0-9), faster but bigger\nvar buf2 = canvas.toBuffer(undefined, 3, canvas.PNG_FILTER_NONE);\n\n// ARGB32 Buffer, native-endian\nvar buf3 = canvas.toBuffer('raw');\nvar stride = canvas.stride;\n// In memory, this is `canvas.height * canvas.stride` bytes long.\n// The top row of pixels, in ARGB order, left-to-right, is:\nvar topPixelsARGBLeftToRight = buf3.slice(0, canvas.width * 4);\nvar row3 = buf3.slice(2 * canvas.stride, 2 * canvas.stride + canvas.width * 4);\n```\n\n### Canvas#toBuffer() async\n\nOptionally we may pass a callback function to `Canvas#toBuffer()`, and this process will be performed asynchronously, and will `callback(err, buf)`.\n\n```javascript\ncanvas.toBuffer(function(err, buf){\n\n});\n```\n\n### Canvas#toDataURL() sync and async\n\nThe following syntax patterns are supported:\n\n```javascript\nvar dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL(); // defaults to PNG\nvar dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL('image/png');\ncanvas.toDataURL(function(err, png){ }); // defaults to PNG\ncanvas.toDataURL('image/png', function(err, png){ });\ncanvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', function(err, jpeg){ }); // sync JPEG is not supported\ncanvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', {opts...}, function(err, jpeg){ }); // see Canvas#jpegStream for valid options\ncanvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', quality, function(err, jpeg){ }); // spec-following; quality from 0 to 1\n```\n\n### CanvasRenderingContext2D#patternQuality\n\nGiven one of the values below will alter pattern (gradients, images, etc) render quality, defaults to _good_.\n\n  - fast\n  - good\n  - best\n  - nearest\n  - bilinear\n\n### CanvasRenderingContext2D#textDrawingMode\n\nCan be either `path` or `glyph`. Using `glyph` is much faster than `path` for drawing, and when using a PDF context will embed the text natively, so will be selectable and lower filesize. The downside is that cairo does not have any subpixel precision for `glyph`, so this will be noticeably lower quality for text positioning in cases such as rotated text. Also, strokeText in `glyph` will act the same as fillText, except using the stroke style for the fill.\n\nDefaults to _path_.\n\nThis property is tracked as part of the canvas state in save/restore.\n\n### CanvasRenderingContext2D#filter\n\nLike `patternQuality`, but applies to transformations effecting more than just patterns. Defaults to _good_.\n\n  - fast\n  - good\n  - best\n  - nearest\n  - bilinear\n\n### Global Composite Operations\n\nIn addition to those specified and commonly implemented by browsers, the following have been added:\n\n  - multiply\n  - screen\n  - overlay\n  - hard-light\n  - soft-light\n  - hsl-hue\n  - hsl-saturation\n  - hsl-color\n  - hsl-luminosity\n\n## Anti-Aliasing\n\n Set anti-aliasing mode\n\n - default\n - none\n - gray\n - subpixel\n\n For example:\n\n```javascript\nctx.antialias = 'none';\n```\n\n## PDF Support\n\n  Basic PDF support was added in 0.11.0. Make sure to install cairo with `--enable-pdf=yes` for the PDF backend. node-canvas must know that it is creating\n  a PDF on initialization, using the \"pdf\" string:\n\n```js\nvar canvas = new Canvas(200, 500, 'pdf');\n```\n\n An additional method `.addPage()` is then available to create\n multiple page PDFs:\n\n```js\nctx.font = '22px Helvetica';\nctx.fillText('Hello World', 50, 80);\nctx.addPage();\n\nctx.font = '22px Helvetica';\nctx.fillText('Hello World 2', 50, 80);\nctx.addPage();\n\nctx.font = '22px Helvetica';\nctx.fillText('Hello World 3', 50, 80);\nctx.addPage();\n```\n\n## SVG support\n\n Just like PDF support, make sure to install cairo with `--enable-svg=yes`.\n You also need to tell node-canvas that it is working on SVG upon its initialization:\n\n```js\nvar canvas = new Canvas(200, 500, 'svg');\n// Use the normal primitives.\nfs.writeFile('out.svg', canvas.toBuffer());\n```\n\n## Benchmarks\n\n Although node-canvas is extremely new, and we have not even begun optimization yet it is already quite fast. For benchmarks vs other node canvas implementations view this [gist](https://gist.github.com/664922), or update the submodules and run `$ make benchmark` yourself.\n\n## Contribute\n\n Want to contribute to node-canvas? patches for features, bug fixes, documentation, examples and others are certainly welcome. Take a look at the [issue queue](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/issues) for existing issues.\n\n## Examples\n\n Examples are placed in _./examples_, be sure to check them out! most produce a png image of the same name, and others such as _live-clock.js_ launch an http server to be viewed in the browser.\n\n## Testing\n\nIf you have not previously, init git submodules:\n\n    $ git submodule update --init\n\nInstall the node modules:\n\n    $ npm install\n\nBuild node-canvas:\n\n    $ node-gyp rebuild\n\nUnit tests:\n\n    $ make test\n\nVisual tests:\n\n    $ make test-server\n\n## Versions\n\nTested with and designed for:\n\n  - node 0.4.2\n  - cairo 1.8.6\n\nFor node 0.2.x `node-canvas` <= 0.4.3 may be used,\n0.5.0 and above are designed for node 0.4.x only.\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2010 LearnBoost, and contributors &lt;dev@learnboost.com&gt;\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Automattic, Inc and contributors
