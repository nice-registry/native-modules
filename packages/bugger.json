It should look similar to this:\n\nchrome-devtools://devtools/bundled/devtools.html?ws=127.0.0.1:8058/websocket\n\nYou can also open `chrome://inspect` if you started Chrome with `--remote-debugging-targets=localhost:8058`.\nThe process should pop up on that page almost immediately.\n\n## Options:\n\n* `-v, --version`: Print version information\n* `-h, --help`: Show usage help\n* `-p, --port`: The devtools protocol port to use, default: 8058\n* `-b, --brk`: Pause on the first line of the script\n\n## Features\n\n### Console Tab\n\n- Basic support for console API\n- Evalute expressions in the console\n- Fully featured repl when not paused (including require)\n- Parts of the [Command Line API](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/debug/command-line/command-line-reference) supported\n\n### Sources Tab\n\n- Step-by-step debugging\n- Variable introspection\n- Live edit the running JavaScript code and persist it using workspaces (really just a Devtools feature)\n- Break on [uncaught] exception\n- Uses existing source maps (e.g. created via `babel --source-maps` or `coffee --map`)\n- [Forked modules](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_fork_modulepath_args_options) show up as worker threads. This includes modules forked via `cluster`.\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- For `babel-core/register` and `coffee-script/register`, editing the files doesn't work [#48](https://github.com/buggerjs/bugger/issues/48)\n\n### Network Tab\n\n- Monitor outgoing http(s) requests your script does\n- Timing of requests, including connect times etc.\n\n### Timeline Tab\n\n- GC events\n- Basic heap usage graphs\n\n#### Known Issues\n\n- The timeline tab doesn't do anything useful right now. In future it should show ([#47](https://github.com/buggerjs/bugger/issues/47)):\n  * `console.{time, timeEnd, timeStamp}`\n  * Network request\n  * Heap usage over time\n  * Profiling data\n\n### Profiles Tab\n\n- Heap snapshots\n- CPU profiles\n- Track heap allocations\n- [Inspect heap objects in the console via `$0..$4`](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/debug/command-line/command-line-reference#section-1)\n\n## Kudos to...\n\n### ...the original projects\n\nbugger was heavily inspired by [node-inspector](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector) and\n[nodebug](https://github.com/billyzkid/nodebug).\n\n## Reference links\n\n- https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/blink.git\n- http://chromedevtools.github.io/debugger-protocol-viewer/Debugger/\n- https://github.com/nodejs/node\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2013-03-27T19:18:11.490Z","modified":"2016-03-21T23:16:29.930Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"jkrems","email":"jan.krems@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"jkrems","email":"jan.krems@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"bugger","_nodeVersion":"4.3.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/bugger-2.3.0.tgz_1458602187496_0.3837117238435894"},"_npmUser":{"name":"jkrems","email":"jan.krems@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.12","_rev":"1-1bee67086720da335991fe27ede339b5","_shasum":"4dd32ff36c8b3f21ac4fe1a967d7d0763203d196","author":{"name":"Jan Krems","email":"jan.krems@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/buggerjs/bugger/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"2.3.0","beta":"2.0.0-beta.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"4dd32ff36c8b3f21ac4fe1a967d7d0763203d196","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/bugger/-/bugger-2.3.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"jkrems","email":"jan.krems@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-03-21T23:16:29.930Z","created":"2013-03-27T19:18:11.490Z","0.2.0":"2013-03-27T19:18:25.049Z","0.2.1":"2013-03-27T20:18:34.178Z","0.2.2":"2013-03-29T13:26:59.835Z","0.2.3":"2013-03-29T13:29:22.901Z","0.2.4":"2013-03-30T21:13:40.784Z","0.2.5":"2013-03-30T21:20:58.246Z","0.2.6":"2013-03-30T22:33:07.381Z","0.3.0":"2013-03-31T12:54:32.580Z","0.3.1":"2013-03-31T14:31:38.324Z","0.3.2":"2013-03-31T14:46:21.026Z","0.4.0":"2013-03-31T17:29:03.308Z","0.4.1":"2013-04-24T15:38:21.046Z","0.4.2":"2013-04-24T16:21:12.650Z","0.4.3":"2013-05-03T16:58:50.077Z","0.5.0-beta1":"2013-05-12T20:37:06.723Z","0.5.0-beta2":"2013-05-12T21:26:46.271Z","0.5.0-beta3":"2013-05-16T17:37:29.481Z","0.5.0-beta5":"2013-07-14T22:53:36.331Z","0.5.0-beta6":"2013-07-15T21:01:18.774Z","0.5.0-beta7":"2013-07-18T21:36:26.980Z","0.5.0":"2013-07-24T18:11:54.411Z","0.5.1":"2013-07-29T08:21:44.993Z","0.5.2":"2013-08-24T12:18:23.586Z","0.6.0":"2013-09-09T19:10:07.355Z","0.6.1":"2013-09-28T11:08:04.969Z","1.0.0":"2015-10-23T16:23:12.926Z","1.1.0":"2015-11-08T22:30:14.154Z","1.2.0":"2015-11-09T00:01:47.104Z","2.0.0-beta.0":"2015-11-16T04:34:28.088Z","2.0.0-beta.1":"2015-11-16T04:53:28.484Z","2.0.0-beta.2":"2015-11-17T05:07:06.507Z","2.0.0-beta.3":"2015-11-17T05:13:25.456Z","2.0.0":"2015-11-17T05:13:51.994Z","2.0.1":"2015-11-17T05:31:06.863Z","2.0.2":"2015-11-17T22:16:47.356Z","2.1.0":"2015-11-18T07:25:15.397Z","2.2.0":"2015-12-03T02:12:30.306Z","2.2.1":"2015-12-03T05:29:26.725Z","2.2.2":"2016-02-05T22:51:53.081Z","2.2.3":"2016-02-09T17:24:37.201Z","2.3.0":"2016-03-21T23:16:29.930Z"},"users":{"despairblue":true}}}
