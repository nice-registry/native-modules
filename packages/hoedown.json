Nö **prøblem**.\") //-> \"<p>¿ÚTF? Nö <strong>prøblem</strong>.</p>\"\n// be sure to reuse the object for blazing speed!\n```\n\n\n## It's flexible\n\nBecause parsing pure Markdown is really boring, you can pass an options object to\n`hoedown()` to customize it. How about making it recognize some extensions?\n\n```js\nvar renderer = hoedown({\n  extensions: hoedown.Extensions.AUTOLINK | hoedown.Extensions.FOOTNOTES\n});\n\nrenderer.do(\"Here's a http://link.com.\") //-> \"<p>Here's a <a href=\"http://link.com\">http://link.com</a>.</p>\"\n```\n\nYou can see the full list of extensions in [the docs](doc/document.markdown#flags_hoedown_extensions).  \nIt's also possible to customize the HTML renderer by passing some [flags](doc/html.markdown#flags_hoedown_html_flags):\n\n```js\nvar renderer = hoedown({\n  extensions: hoedown.Extensions.AUTOLINK | hoedown.Extensions.FOOTNOTES,\n  renderer: {\n    flags: hoedown.HTML.Flags.HARD_WRAP | hoedown.HTML.Flags.ESCAPE\n  }\n});\n\nrenderer.do(\"Roses are red.\\nViolets are blue.\") //-> \"<p>Roses are red.<br>Violets are blue.</p>\"\n```\n\nThe full options accepted by the HTML renderer can be found at [the docs](doc).\nYou can also use the TOC renderer to render a Table of Contents of the document,\nas in [this example](example/withtoc.js).\n\n#### Other things\n\nHoedown comes with a fully functional implementation of [SmartyPants][].\nYou can also access Hoedown's version, use the autolinker, escape things, etc.\nCheck out the [docs](doc) and the [examples](example)!\n\n\n## It's secure\n\nHoedown is all about security. It has been extensively tested to make sure it won't\ncrash or leak under any input. If you believe you have found a vulnerability,\n[report it there][Hoedown bugs].\n\nThat said, the HTML produced by Hoedown is *not* secure. Unless you're using the\n`ESCAPE` or `SKIP_HTML` flags, you should really consider sanitizing the HTML.\n\n\n## No custom renderers?\n\nUsers coming from Robotskirt may notice these bindings don't offer the possibility\nof including custom callbacks in renderers, or create pure JS renderers. There are\nmany reasons for that, notably:\n\n * **Painfully slow:** the constant switches between C++ and JS decrease performance.\n * **Often useless:** the callbacks had to be synchronous, which totally stopped you from\n   working with asynchronous libraries.\n\nIf you need further processing, it's better to process the rendered output (if it's\nHTML, you can use jsdom for instance). FIXME: mention JSON\n\n**Tip:** If you need code highlighting, just include [Prism][] in your site,\nit'll automatically highlight your fenced code blocks.\n\n\n\n[Hoedown]: https://github.com/hoedown/hoedown\n[Hoedown bugs]: https://github.com/hoedown/hoedown#help-us\n[Sundown]: https://github.com/vmg/sundown\n[Prism]: http://prismjs.com\n[SmartyPants]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants\n","created":"2014-03-25T07:11:04.400Z","modified":"2015-06-25T09:08:14.120Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"jmendeth","email":"me@jmendeth.com"},"owners":[{"name":"jmendeth","email":"jmendeth@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"hoedown","_nodeVersion":"0.12.0","_npmUser":{"name":"jmendeth","email":"me@jmendeth.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.5.1","_rev":"1-457ce4172020d10dc95fdb028cd20eaa","_shasum":"c09de70251046e88037474c28fd7ecc0c7a575d5","author":{"name":"Xavier Mendez","email":"jmendeth@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/hoedown/node-hoedown/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"Xavier Mendez","email":"jmendeth@gmail.com"}],"directories":{"src":"src","doc":"doc","example":"example"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.4.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"c09de70251046e88037474c28fd7ecc0c7a575d5","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/hoedown/-/hoedown-0.4.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"jmendeth","email":"jmendeth@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-06-25T09:08:14.120Z","created":"2014-03-25T07:11:04.400Z","0.0.0":"2014-03-25T07:11:04.400Z","0.0.1":"2014-03-28T17:40:36.868Z","0.0.2":"2014-04-01T19:04:53.792Z","0.1.0":"2014-04-02T18:32:41.732Z","0.1.1":"2014-05-08T16:35:49.196Z","0.2.0":"2014-05-14T17:07:25.043Z","0.3.0":"2014-11-08T22:22:55.506Z","0.4.1":"2015-06-25T09:08:14.120Z"}}}
