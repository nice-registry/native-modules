To change this, you must simply do a search and replace in `src/I2Cdev.cpp`. I may go back and make this configurable at runtime, but I'd like to expose some of the other MPU and DMP configuration options via the module exports and intialization routine first. \n\n## Credits and License\n\nThe DMP initialization routine borrows code from Richard Hirst's [MPU6050-Pi-Demo](https://github.com/richardghirst/PiBits/tree/master/MPU6050-Pi-Demo), which ports a ton of functionality to Raspberry Pi from Jeff Rowberg's [i2cdevlib](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib). \n\nThis project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.\n","created":"2015-08-16T18:08:22.133Z","modified":"2015-09-28T19:32:57.841Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"mattcarpenter","email":"mattcarpenter@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"mattcarpenter","email":"mattcarpenter@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"mpu6050-dmp","_nodeVersion":"0.12.4","_npmUser":{"name":"mattcarpenter","email":"mattcarpenter@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.10.1","_rev":"1-ceb91d7b067b168630ed9442d9a998e0","_shasum":"c792023f82d5fad8a591dea80b7314120bdbe586","author":{"name":"Matt Carpenter"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mattcarpenter/mpu6050-dmp/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.6"},"dist":{"shasum":"c792023f82d5fad8a591dea80b7314120bdbe586","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/mpu6050-dmp/-/mpu6050-dmp-0.0.6.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"mattcarpenter","email":"mattcarpenter@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-09-28T19:32:57.841Z","created":"2015-08-16T18:08:22.133Z","0.0.0":"2015-08-16T18:08:22.133Z","0.0.1":"2015-08-16T18:14:23.769Z","0.0.2":"2015-08-16T18:17:09.401Z","0.0.3":"2015-08-16T18:19:33.857Z","0.0.4":"2015-08-16T18:33:20.621Z","0.0.5":"2015-08-16T18:44:15.613Z","0.0.6":"2015-09-28T19:32:57.841Z"}}}
