There is example:  \n\n```javascript\n'use strict';\nconst ioHook = require('iohook');\n\nioHook.on(\"mousemove\", event => {\n  console.log(event);\n  /* You get object like this\n    {\n      type: 'mousemove',\n      x: 700,\n      y: 400\n    }\n   */\n});\n\n//Register and start hook\nioHook.start();\n```\nIf type ```ioHook.start(true);``` you can enable debug logger in native lib. Use it if you have troubles with this module\n\n\n### Available events\n\n### keypress (NOT WORKING AT THIS MOMENT, USE keydown/keyup)\nCalls when user press and release a key. Event contain next object:  \n`{keychar: 'f', keycode: 19, rawcode: 15, type: 'keypress'}`\n\n### keydown\nCalls when user press a key. Event contain next object:  \n`{ keychar: 'd', keycode: 46, rawcode: 8, type: 'keydown' }`\n\n### keyup\nCalls when user release a key. Event contain next object:  \n`{keychar: 'f', keycode: 19, rawcode: 15, type: 'keup'}`\n\n### mouseclick\nCalls when user click mouse button. Event contain next object:  \n`{ button: 1, clicks: 1, x: 545, y: 696, type: 'mouseclick' }`\n\n### mousedown\nCalls when user press and release a key. Event contain next object:  \n`{ button: 1, clicks: 1, x: 545, y: 696, type: 'mousedown' }`\n\n### mouseup\nCalls when user press and release a key. Event contain next object:  \n`{ button: 1, clicks: 1, x: 545, y: 696, type: 'mouseup' }`\n\n### mousemove\nCalls when user press and release a key. Event contain next object:  \n`{ button: 0, clicks: 0, x: 521, y: 737, type: 'mousemove' }`\n\n### mousedrag\nCalls when user press and release a key. Event contain next object:  \n`{ button: 0, clicks: 0, x: 373, y: 683, type: 'mousedrag' }`\n\n### mousewheel\nCalls when user press and release a key. Event contain next object:  \n`{ amount: 3, clicks: 1, direction: 3, rotation: 1, type: 'mousewheel', x: 466, y: 683 }`\n\n## Known issues\nIn some cases, most often when you make mouse moves or keyboard events very fast,\nmodule crash with \"Segmentation fault: 11\". Looks like it is problem in my native implementation,\nbut I still can't find a problem. Will be happy if somebody helps with it.\n\n## Credits\nThanks for [libuiohook](https://github.com/kwhat/libuiohook) project!    \nThank you [ayoubserti](https://github.com/ayoubserti) for first iohook prototype  \nThank you [vespakoen](https://github.com/vespakoen) for prebuild system implementation\n","starsCount":3,"created":"2016-12-10T22:09:28.388Z","modified":"2017-07-12T11:31:35.014Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"wilix-lead","email":"root@wilix.ru"},"owners":[{"email":"root@wilix.ru","name":"wilix-lead"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"iohook","_nodeVersion":"7.9.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/iohook-0.1.9.tgz_1494503309889_0.3337635446805507"},"_npmUser":{"name":"wilix-lead","email":"root@wilix.ru"},"_npmVersion":"4.2.0","_rev":"22-38c390af68502b2b9e09c8d85edef6be","_shasum":"cbdc5b4c3b8f375097848d2f9c85663e79fc013f","author":{"name":"Aloyan Dmitry"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/WilixLead/iohook/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.9"},"dist":{"shasum":"cbdc5b4c3b8f375097848d2f9c85663e79fc013f","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/iohook/-/iohook-0.1.9.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"email":"root@wilix.ru","name":"wilix-lead"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-07-12T11:31:35.014Z","created":"2016-12-10T22:09:28.388Z","0.0.1":"2016-12-10T22:09:28.388Z","0.0.2":"2016-12-10T22:38:51.049Z","0.0.3":"2016-12-18T21:14:59.902Z","0.0.4":"2016-12-29T12:52:03.711Z","0.0.5":"2017-01-02T17:20:38.891Z","0.0.6":"2017-01-13T17:02:40.343Z","0.0.7":"2017-01-13T17:15:58.281Z","0.0.8":"2017-01-13T17:24:11.002Z","0.0.9":"2017-01-13T17:31:33.436Z","0.1.0":"2017-01-16T16:42:21.231Z","0.1.1":"2017-01-16T18:03:53.383Z","0.1.2":"2017-01-16T18:26:18.909Z","0.1.4":"2017-04-16T01:04:14.752Z","0.1.6":"2017-04-18T08:31:15.151Z","0.1.7":"2017-04-20T10:13:22.412Z","0.1.8":"2017-04-20T11:54:53.859Z","0.1.9":"2017-05-11T11:48:32.010Z"},"users":{"wilix-lead":true,"ahvonenj":true,"bigglesatlarge":true}}}
