But I have not been able to\nget a stable image/animation using a Raspberry Pi 3. It might be my long cables.\nJust a heads up.\n\n## Constructor\n\n### new Matrix(config)\n\nConstructs a new matrix object. The **config** argument must contain the following values.\n\n- **width**      - Specifies the width of the display.\n- **height**     - Specifies the height of the display.\n- **hardware**   - Set to 'none' to just log to console.\n\nIf **config** is not specified all methods will only log to console and no hardware is accessed.\n\nExample\n\n\tvar Matrix = require('hzeller-matrix');\n\tvar matrix = new Matrix({width:32, height:32})\n\t...\n\n## Methods\n\n### matrix.runText(text, options, callback)\n\nThis method displays scrolling text.\nThe **callback** argument is called when the animation completes.\nThe **options** argument may have the following values.\n\n- **textColor** - Changes text color. Default is red.\n- **fontName** - Use the specified TrueType font.\n- **fontSize** - Change the font size.\n- **duration** - Run  no longer this number of seconds. Default is -1, that is until the text is fully displayed.\n- **delay** - Scroll delay in milliseconds.\n- **speed** - Speed factor. Default 1.0. Lesser value slows down the animation. Greater value speeds it up.\n- **iterations** - Number of iterations to display the text. Default is 1. -1 == infinity.\n\nExample\n\n\tmatrix.runText('Hello World', {textColor: 'blue', fontSize:30});\n\n\n### matrix.runImage(image, options, callback)\n\nDisplay an image. The image parameter may be a string representing the file\nname or a JavaScript **Buffer** object.\nThe **callback** argument is called when the animation completes.\nThe **options** argument may have the following values.\n\n- **scroll** - Specifies the direction to scroll the image. Valid values are 'left', 'right', 'up', 'down' or 'auto'. Default is 'auto'.\n- **pause** - Specifies the time, in seconds, to pause after scroll has finished.\n- **duration** - Number of seconds to animate. Default is 60 seconds.\n- **delay** - Animation delay during display loop in milliseconds.\n- **iterations** - Number of iterations to display the image. -1 == infinity.\n- **speed** - Speed factor. Default 1.0. Lesser value slows down the animation. Greater value speeds it up.\n\n### matrix.runAmination(gifFile, options, callback)\n\nRuns an animated GIF, frame by frame.\nThe **callback** argument is called when the animation completes.\nThe **options** argument may have the following values.\n\n- **duration** - Number of seconds to animate. Default is 60 seconds.\n- **delay** - Animation frame delay i milliseconds if the value is missing in the GIF.\n- **speed** - Speed factor. Default 1.0. Lesser value slows down the animation. Greater value speeds it up.\n- **iterations** - Number of iterations to animate. Default is -1, that is infinite.\n\n### matrix.runRain(options, callback)\n\nDisplays a Matrix-like rain animation. The **options** are as follows.\nThe **callback** argument is called when the animation completes.\nThe **options** argument may have the following values.\n\n- **hue** - Specifies the hue of the rain. If not specified, it will use the time of day to specify the hue.\n- **duration** - Run the animation for **duration** seconds. -1 == inifinity.\n- **delay** - Animation delay during display loop in milliseconds.\n- **speed** - Speed factor. Default 1.0. Lesser value slows down the animation. Greater value speeds it up.\n\n\n### matrix.runPerlin(options, callback)\n\nRuns a perlin animation.\nThe **callback** argument is called when the animation completes.\nThe *options* argument may have the following values.\n\n- **mode** - Valid modes are 1, 2 or 3.\n- **duration** - Run the animation for **duration** seconds. -1 == inifinity.\n- **delay** - Animation delay during display loop in milliseconds.\n- **speed** - Speed factor. Default 1.0. Lesser value slows down the animation. Greater value speeds it up.\n\n### matrix.runClock(image, options, callback)\n\nDisplays a clock with the specified look. See  https://github.com/meg768/hzeller-matrix-example\nfor examples of clock images.\n\nThe **callback** argument is called when the animation completes.\nThe *options* argument may have the following values.\n\n- **duration** - Run the animation for **duration** seconds. -1 == inifinity.\n\n### matrix.isRunning()\n\nReturns true/false if an animation is running or not.\n\n## Properties\n\n### matrix.width\nReturns the matrix width.\n\n### matrix.height\nReturns the matrix height.\n\n## See also\n\nCheck out https://github.com/meg768/hzeller-matrix-example for more information.\n\n\n## Build Instructions\n\nInstructions how to se up and compile **hzeller-matrix** as of 2016-07-27.\n\n### Install Raspbian image.\n\nInstall image 2016-05-27-raspbian-jessie-lite.img. For the Mac, use **Pi Filler**.\n\n### Find out the IP-address of the Raspberry\n\nFor the Mac, use Lan Scan or Lan Scan Pro.
