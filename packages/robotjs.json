Instructions for [Electron](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/wiki/Electron).\n\n## Examples\n\n##### [Mouse](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/wiki/Syntax#mouse)\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://cldup.com/lugVjjAkEi.gif\"></p>\n\n```JavaScript\n// Move the mouse across the screen as a sine wave.\nvar robot = require(\"robotjs\");\n\n// Speed up the mouse.\nrobot.setMouseDelay(2);\n\nvar twoPI = Math.PI * 2.0;\nvar screenSize = robot.getScreenSize();\nvar height = (screenSize.height / 2) - 10;\nvar width = screenSize.width;\n\nfor (var x = 0; x < width; x++)\n{\n\ty = height * Math.sin((twoPI * x) / width) + height;\n\trobot.moveMouse(x, y);\n}\n```\n\n##### [Keyboard](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/wiki/Syntax#keyboard)\n\n```JavaScript\n// Type \"Hello World\" then press enter.\nvar robot = require(\"robotjs\");\n\n// Type \"Hello World\".\nrobot.typeString(\"Hello World\");\n\n// Press enter.\nrobot.keyTap(\"enter\");\n```\n\n##### [Screen](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/wiki/Syntax#screen)\n\n```JavaScript\n// Get pixel color under the mouse.\nvar robot = require(\"robotjs\");\n\n// Get mouse position.\nvar mouse = robot.getMousePos();\n\n// Get pixel color in hex format.\nvar hex = robot.getPixelColor(mouse.x, mouse.y);\nconsole.log(\"#\" + hex + \" at x:\" + mouse.x + \" y:\" + mouse.y);\n```\nRead the [Wiki](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/wiki) for more information!\n\n## [API](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/wiki/Syntax)\n\nThe [RobotJS API](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/wiki/Syntax) is contained in the [Wiki](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/wiki).\n\n## Building\n\nPlease ensure you have the required dependencies before installing:\n\n* Windows\n  * Visual Studio 2013 (Express works fine).\n  * Python (v2.7.3 recommended, v3.x.x is not supported).\n* Mac\n  * Xcode Command Line Tools.\n* Linux\n  * Python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x is not supported).\n  * make.\n  * A C/C++ compiler like GCC.\n  * libxtst-dev and libpng++-dev (`sudo apt-get install libxtst-dev libpng++-dev`).\n\nInstall node-gyp using npm:\n\n```\nnpm install -g node-gyp\n```\n\nThen build:\n\n```\nnode-gyp rebuild\n```\n\nSee the [node-gyp readme](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) for more details.\n\n## Plans\n\n* √ Control the mouse by changing the mouse position, left/right clicking, and dragging.\n* √ Control the keyboard by pressing keys, holding keys down, and typing words.\n* √ Read pixel color from the screen and capture the screen.\n* Find an image on screen, read pixels from an image.\n* Possibly include window management?\n\n## Progress\n\n| Module        | Status        | Notes   |\n| ------------- |-------------: | ------- |\n| Mouse         | 100%           | All planned features implemented.       |\n| Keyboard      | 100%           | All planned features implemented.       |\n| Screen        | 85%            | Image search, pixel search. |\n| Bitmap        | 0%             |  Saving/opening, png support.  |\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Does RobotJS support global hotkeys? \n\nNot currently, and I don't know if it ever will. I personally use [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)/[NW.js](http://nwjs.io/) for global hotkeys, and this works well. Later on I might add hotkey support or create a separate module. See [#55](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/issues/55) for details. \n\n#### Can I take a screenshot with RobotJS? \n\nSoon! This is a bit more complicated than the rest of the features, so I saved it for last. Luckily the code is already there, I just need to write the bindings, and I've already started. Subscribe to [#13](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/issues/13) for updates. \n\n#### Why is &#60;insert key&#62; missing from the keyboard functions? \n\nWe've been implementing keys as we need them. Feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request!\n\n#### How about multi-monitor support?\n\nThe library doesn't have explicit multi-monitor support, so anything that works is kind of on accident. Subscribe to [#88](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/issues/88) for updates.\n\nFor any other questions please [submit an issue](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/issues/new).\n\n## Story\n\nI'm a huge fan of [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/), and I've used it for a very long time. AutoHotkey is great for automation and it can do a bunch of things that are very difficult in other languages. For example, it's [imagesearch](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/ImageSearch.htm) and [pixel](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/PixelGetColor.htm) related functions are hard to reproduce on Mac, especially in scripting languages. These functions are great for automating apps that can't be automated like [Netflix](http://blueshirtdesign.com/apps/autoflix/). This has never been a big deal since I've always used Windows at work, but for the past few years I've been using Mac exclusively. \n\nI like AutoHotkey, but I like Node.js more. By developing RobotJS I get an AutoHotkey replacement on Mac (finally!), and I get to use my favorite language. \n\n**TLDR:** There's nothing like AutoHotkey on Mac, so I'm making it. \n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\nBased on [autopy](https://github.com/msanders/autopy). \nMaintained by [Jason Stallings](http://jason.stallin.gs).\n","starsCount":41,"created":"2014-09-01T16:53:29.585Z","modified":"2017-07-12T17:20:20.425Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"octalmage","email":"jason@stallin.gs"},"owners":[{"name":"octalmage","email":"jason@stallin.gs"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"robotjs","_nodeVersion":"6.2.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/robotjs-0.4.7.tgz_1490565508955_0.8495004845317453"},"_npmUser":{"name":"octalmage","email":"jason@stallin.gs"},"_npmVersion":"4.1.2","_rev":"16-6d4d1af9e561d308ab4e46de6baac818","_shasum":"b2d20311381d7e76665417c0ac66882e69f78132","author":{"name":"Jason Stallings"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.4.7"},"dist":{"shasum":"b2d20311381d7e76665417c0ac66882e69f78132","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/robotjs/-/robotjs-0.4.7.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"octalmage","email":"jason@stallin.gs"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-07-12T17:20:20.425Z","created":"2014-09-01T16:53:29.585Z","0.0.1":"2014-09-01T16:53:29.585Z","0.0.2":"2014-09-01T17:22:23.088Z","0.0.3":"2015-01-20T00:24:43.583Z","0.0.4":"2015-01-30T16:31:23.190Z","0.0.5":"2015-02-04T16:25:43.940Z","0.1.0":"2015-02-04T21:30:28.051Z","0.1.1":"2015-02-07T00:02:07.460Z","0.1.2":"2015-04-26T07:13:09.687Z","0.1.3":"2015-07-18T05:54:03.196Z","0.1.4":"2015-07-19T07:42:35.759Z","0.2.0":"2015-07-25T23:40:20.899Z","0.2.1":"2015-07-26T01:31:37.365Z","0.2.2":"2015-08-01T19:42:32.024Z","0.2.3":"2015-08-05T04:05:53.034Z","0.2.4":"2015-08-28T00:26:17.431Z","0.3.0":"2015-10-04T13:14:04.441Z","0.3.1":"2015-10-12T16:36:34.696Z","0.3.2":"2015-10-28T01:32:14.901Z","0.3.3":"2015-11-02T16:38:37.134Z","0.3.4":"2015-11-22T01:48:34.377Z","0.3.5":"2015-12-07T17:20:20.280Z","0.3.6":"2015-12-14T00:55:46.896Z","0.3.7":"2015-12-29T10:05:56.008Z","0.4.0":"2016-04-17T18:02:00.203Z","0.4.1":"2016-04-17T21:31:05.690Z","0.4.2":"2016-05-08T21:23:12.286Z","0.4.3":"2016-05-30T16:58:28.807Z","0.4.4":"2016-06-01T00:46:57.492Z","0.4.5":"2016-10-16T20:55:27.957Z","0.4.6":"2017-03-26T21:23:23.469Z","0.4.7":"2017-03-26T21:58:29.730Z"},"users":{"arahnoid":true,"octalmage":true,"sammyteahan":true,"developit":true,"ibakaidov":true,"alectic":true,"acollins-ts":true,"nelix":true,"abhisekp":true,"igormilla":true,"pdedkov":true,"brunocalou":true,"amthenia":true,"sky3r":true,"bdeanindy":true,"jasonevrtt":true,"lindstrm":true,"ufukomer":true,"limero":true,"leebinpm":true,"ahme-t":true,"inlife":true,"isaacvitor":true,"driglou":true,"adrianoferreira":true,"szymex73":true,"ellyo":true,"mrmasly":true,"brackcarmony":true,"marceloneias":true,"shanewholloway":true,"chirag8642":true,"rocket0191":true,"sangpire":true,"carlos_en14":true,"hawkite":true,"swak":true,"grabantot":true,"metaa":true,"alfeo92":true,"hongpark":true}}}
