[This library also supports *secure* devices](../master/README-security.md)\n(eg door locks) that require encryption.\n\nAll widely used Node.js versions are supported with the help of [NaN](https://github.com/nodejs/nan).\nThis add-on is currently tested against 0.12.x on ARM and 4.2.x on x86_64, but\nit should also work on all supported Node.js versions (as early as 0.11.12) and\narchitectures.\n\nCheck out the [Node-Red integration project](https://github.com/OpenZWave/node-red-contrib-openzwave)\nfor an interesting use case, in which I've wired up ZWave and KNX devices\nworking together as one big happy automated home.\n\nThis addon is currently able to:\n- *scan* a Z-Wave network and report on connected devices,\n- *write* values to zwave nodes\n- *monitor* the network for changes,\n- *heal* nodes and/or the network\n- *perform* management tasks (add/remove nodes, replace failed nodes, manage\n\ttheir group associations etc)\n\n**Important notice**\n\nThis library differs from its [ancestor library](https://github.com/jperkin/node-openzwave)\nin that it links *dynamically* to an OpenZWave **shared library**\nby means of your system dynamic linker. This is  in contrast to\n*statically* linking OpenZWave as part of the node.js addon.\n\nThus you need to have OpenZWave fully installed on your system (both the\ncompiled library AND the development headers) before trying to install this\nlittle baby.\nI know this diverges from the dominant npm paradigm, but with the shared lib approach:\n  - compilation / installation is a lot faster and\n  - OZW *minor* upgrades / bugfixes are way lot easier.\n\nThis also means that you need to be careful if you upgrade your\nOZW library: you might need to rebuild this addon, otherwise you'd might\nget api mismatch exceptions.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n### Linux\n\nYou will need to ensure the OpenZWave library and headers are\ninstalled first. You can do this one of two ways.\n\n- Manually compiling OpenZwave involves the usual dance of 1) downloading its source tarball\n([latest code from GitHub](https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave/archive/master.zip) or\n[a stable release](https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave/releases)) or\nfrom [the OpenZWave snapshots repository](http://old.openzwave.com/snapshots/)\nand then 2) compiling it and installing on your system (`make && sudo make install`)\n\n- You could also install OpenZWave via a [precompiled package that's suitable for\nyour Linux distribution and architecture](http://old.openzwave.com/downloads/).\n**Notice:** Be sure to install *BOTH the binary (libopenzwave-x.y) AND the\ndevelopment package (libopenzwave-dev).*\n\n### MacOS/X\n\nThe only dependency that you need before compiling is `pkg-config`. Then, you\ncould either pull down the OZW repo from Github and do a `make && sudo make install` ,\nor you could try installing OpenZWave using `brew install open-zwave`.\n\n### Windows\n\nSince there is no standard installation location for Open Z-Wave on Windows, it\nwill be automatically downloaded, compiled, and installed when you install this module.\n\n## Installation and test script\n\nWhenever you have OpenZWave installed in your machine, then all you need to do is:\n\n```\n$ npm install openzwave-shared\n```\n\nTo try it out, boot up NodeJS, and use the `.load` shell helper function to boot up a basic OpenZWave CLI. This will initialise and expose 1) a `zwave` object that you can use to send commands and 2) the `nodes` object to get a list of all nodes:\n\n```js\n$ node\n> .load test2.js\n...\n...\n\n// the 1st node is the USB controller stick\n> console.log(nodes[1])\n{ manufacturer: 'Aeotec',\n  manufacturerid: '0x0086',\n  product: 'Z-Stick S2',\n  producttype: '0x0002',\n  productid: '0x0001',\n  type: 'Static PC Controller',\n  name: '',\n  loc: '',\n  classes: { '32': { '0': [Object] } },\n  ready: true }\n\n// set dimmer (node 5) to 50%\n> zwave.setValue(5,38,1,0,50);\nundefined\n> node5: changed: 38:Level:54->54\n```\n\n**Notice 1:** If you receive the error `cannot find -lopenzwave` on a 64-bit Linux\nsystem, `libopenzwave.so` was likely compiled into `/usr/local/lib64`.\nRun the terminal command `ld -lopenzwave --verbose` for a list of search\nlocations used. You can workaround this by providing a symlink to one of the\nlisted locations such as `/usr/local/lib`.\nRun `sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib64/libopenzwave.so /usr/local/lib/libopenzwave.so`\ncreates symlink so that the file appears to be in the location that `ld` looks\nin. Now `npm install` should work.\n\n**Notice 2:** nodejs Debian/Raspbian package (v0.10.29) causes an issue REPLACE_INVALID_UTF8 (cf. https://github.com/nodejs/nan/issues/414). You can use node from [herokuapp](http://node-arm.herokuapp.com/) or upgrade some node packages: `sudo npm -g install npm node-gyp`.\n\nIn case you want to develop your application in TypeScript, there is also a TypeScript\ndeclaration file available. Besides adding typechecking to your codebase this will also\nhelp you to navigate the API and see the type of parameters available for each function. You can\ndownload the\n[latest version of the declaration file from GitHub](https://github.com/jbaron/openzwave-shared-tsd).\n\n## Development documentation\n\n- [Basic API usage](../master/README-api.md)\n- [List of supported events](../master/README-events.md)\n- [Management of nodes](../master/README-mgmt.md)\n- [Security API](../master/README-security.md)\n- [Usage example](../master/README-example.md)\n\n## Environment-specific documentation\n- [Installing on Rapsbian](../master/README-raspbian.md)\n- [Installing on Ubuntu 15.04](../master/README-ubuntu.md)\n\n## License\n\nThe [Open Z-Wave](http://www.openzwave.com/) library that this\nmodule heavily relies upon is licensed under the Lesser GPLv3.\n\nEverything else (all the bits that I and Jonathan have written)\nis under the vastly more sensible ISC license.\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2015-05-19T17:49:07.225Z","modified":"2017-05-31T20:11:13.323Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"ekarak","email":"elias.karakoulakis@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"ekarak","email":"elias.karakoulakis@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"openzwave-shared","_nodeVersion":"7.3.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/openzwave-shared-1.4.0.tgz_1496261472107_0.1068715900182724"},"_npmUser":{"name":"ekarak","email":"elias.karakoulakis@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.0.5","_rev":"14-998ad21d2f5253dd80e00777f4dca503","_shasum":"3c26cb9f192b813e0ebeeb1a931c9f3b7e03a169","author":{"name":"Elias Karakoulakis","email":"elias.karakoulakis@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/OpenZWave/node-openzwave-shared/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"davide-lr"},{"name":"Justin Hammond"},{"name":"Jonathan Perkin","url":"http://www.perkin.org.uk/"},{"name":"Luke Hertert","url":"http://werul.com"},{"name":"Michiel Mooring"},{"name":"Thibaut CONSTANT"},{"name":"Henry Rawas"},{"name":"Rushi Desai"},{"name":"Steven Adams"},{"name":"Jan Erik Hanssen"},{"name":"Brennan Kinney"},{"name":"Adam Rensel"},{"name":"David Moxey"},{"name":"Bart Bakker"},{"name":"vectah0"},{"name":"yybd"},{"name":"Rob Huehn"},{"name":"Michael Franken"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.4.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"3c26cb9f192b813e0ebeeb1a931c9f3b7e03a169","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/openzwave-shared/-/openzwave-shared-1.4.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"ekarak","email":"elias.karakoulakis@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-05-31T20:11:13.323Z","created":"2015-05-19T17:49:07.225Z","0.0.1":"2015-05-19T17:49:07.225Z","0.0.2":"2015-05-20T20:16:00.816Z","0.1.0":"2015-05-24T20:19:29.753Z","1.0.0":"2015-06-14T21:31:32.983Z","1.0.1":"2015-08-01T02:52:15.646Z","1.0.2":"2015-08-31T18:56:04.921Z","1.0.3":"2015-08-31T18:58:09.662Z","1.0.4":"2015-08-31T19:04:01.715Z","1.0.5":"2015-09-16T18:36:49.956Z","1.0.6":"2015-09-23T21:50:04.091Z","1.0.8":"2015-09-26T09:32:16.272Z","1.0.9":"2015-09-29T03:42:20.487Z","1.1.0":"2015-10-05T19:58:53.495Z","1.1.2":"2015-10-12T06:10:52.408Z","1.1.3":"2015-10-12T19:26:14.676Z","1.1.4":"2015-10-24T13:40:18.801Z","1.1.5":"2015-11-25T06:27:07.511Z","1.1.6":"2015-12-04T10:16:21.667Z","1.1.7":"2016-02-07T18:56:52.842Z","1.1.8":"2016-03-08T20:04:15.314Z","1.1.9":"2016-03-10T18:05:43.588Z","1.2.0":"2016-04-24T06:45:49.536Z","1.2.2":"2016-12-05T19:59:00.967Z","1.2.3":"2016-12-08T19:22:27.853Z","1.2.5":"2016-12-19T21:09:02.871Z","1.2.6":"2017-01-05T13:56:49.759Z","1.2.7":"2017-01-05T22:18:15.199Z","1.2.8":"2017-01-17T22:10:05.948Z","1.2.9":"2017-01-18T18:47:21.643Z","1.3.0":"2017-01-22T09:37:29.792Z","1.3.1":"2017-01-30T19:57:27.110Z","1.3.2":"2017-03-03T18:49:15.595Z","1.3.3":"2017-04-05T17:53:07.040Z","1.3.4":"2017-04-14T08:02:06.530Z","1.4.0":"2017-05-31T20:11:13.323Z"},"users":{"goliatone":true}}}
