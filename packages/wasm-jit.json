The main\nnpm dependencies are:\n\n- [wasm-ast][0] - parsing source string into AST form, which is similar to\n  [Mozilla's AST][2] in many ways\n- [wasm-cfg][1] - taking the source and transforming it into Control Flow Graph\n- [json-pipeline][3] - basement for CFG graph, and for generic sea-of-nodes\n  graph\n- [ssa.js][4], [dominance-frontier][5] - building SSA form out of non-SSA CFG\n- [json-pipeline-reducer][6] - performing reductions on sea-of-nodes graph\n- [gvn][9] - Global Value Numbering algorithm, for removing common\n  sub-expressions\n- [json-pipeline-scheduler][7] - scheduling sea-of-nodes back to CFG\n- [jit.js][8] - generating machine code out of CFG\n\n### Directories\n\n- `lib/*.js` - has very generic, API related files and entities like:\n  - `compiler.js` - a Compiler instance and APIs\n  - `pipeline.js` - responsible for transforming CFG to the machine code,\n    invokes all reductions and optimizations\n  - `ref-table.js` - RefTable instance, holds references to modules'\n    functions (both exported and internal), also holds `namespace` hashmap, used\n    for looking up imported functions\n  - `std` - standard library module, and context creation API\n- `lib/<platform-name>/**/*.js` - platform-specific implementation (or base\n  for all platform implementations):\n  - `codegen/` - instance, responsible for generating machine code out of the\n    CFG, invoked by `lib/pipeline.js`\n  - `codegen/builder.js` - convenience methods for defining opcodes on the\n    Codegen (see `builder.opcode()` throughout the code base)\n  - `reductions/` - holds optimizing and instruction selecting reductions,\n    invoked by `lib/pipeline.js`. May have different reduction phases, which\n    will be invoked in specific order by `lib/pipeline.js`\n  - `gvn/` - Global Value Numbering relations, i.e. the criteria for determining\n    that two expressions are equivalent, and could be replaced by a single one\n\nEach reduction and GVN relation have their own tests. Platform tests live in\n`test/<platform-name>`. General tests in `test/*-test.js`.\n\n## LICENSE\n\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright Fedor Indutny, 2015.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
