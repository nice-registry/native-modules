In this implementation this list of words is nothing more than a list of IDs of words as listed in a *__Dictionary of Visual Words__*. You can then use this list of words either for indexing your image in your favorite DB or to search the DB for a similar image.\n\nThe way the list of words is generated is by first extracting the features of the image that has been passed and then by looking in the *dictionary* for features that are similar to the ones we extracted from the image.\n\nYou have two options in terms of what dictionary to use:\n\n- Use the pre-trained visual words that comes with PASTEC;\n\n- Create your own dictionary by using our very simple trainer and feeding it your images to create the dictionary.\n\nOur implementation of the trainer is (also) pretty naive - and may not scale well, especially in terms of performance, as your image dataset grows.\n\nWhat the trainer does is extract features from each image and then add to the dictionary of visual words only those features that are not within a specific distance from existing words.\n\n ## And now for some practical examples\n\n _**\"Code speaks louder than words!\"**_, *Mark Twain, Circa 1972*\n\n### Installing\n\nInstalling this node module requires that you have already installed _**OpenCV**_ on your system; this has been tested with *__OpenCV version 2.4.x__*.\n\n```sh\nnpm install node-orbidx\n```\n\n### Initializing the indexer\n\n ```javascript\nconst OrbIndexer = require('node-orbidx');\n\nvar orbIndexer = new OrbIndexer();\n ```\n\nThis piece of code will create  an indexer with all the default settings; that means it will be using the same options for ORB features extraction as __PASTEC__ and the same visual word dictionary.\n\nWhat makes this a great tool for experimenting with ORB based visual search is that you can pass a set of options that will allow you to use any customized set of options for ORB features extraction and your very own visual words dictionary.\n\n*When using the original PASTEC words dictionary you may see better results by sticking to the PASTEC options for ORB features extraction.*\n\n### Indexer options\n\nSee the [API](docs/api.md) for a detailed description of the options that can be passed to the constructor of the indexer.\n\n# More Documentation\n\n[A simple example of usage](docs/example.md)\n\n[Create your own visual words dictionary](docs/dictionary.md)\n\n[API Documentation](docs/api.md)\n","created":"2016-06-06T21:16:54.154Z","modified":"2016-06-07T13:33:02.832Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"mrwho","email":"mrwho@wedjaa.net"},"owners":[{"name":"mrwho","email":"mrwho@wedjaa.net"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"node-orbidx","_nodeVersion":"6.0.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/node-orbidx-1.0.20.tgz_1465306380591_0.32316047116182745"},"_npmUser":{"name":"mrwho","email":"mrwho@wedjaa.net"},"_npmVersion":"3.8.6","_rev":"1-edb064b75f69890de66c89b10e60a245","_shasum":"78cfe71cdb7933f8d6c967ec0b86e35e6a2389a8","author":{"name":"Fabio 'MrWHO' Torchetti"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.20"},"dist":{"shasum":"78cfe71cdb7933f8d6c967ec0b86e35e6a2389a8","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/node-orbidx/-/node-orbidx-1.0.20.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"mrwho","email":"mrwho@wedjaa.net"}],"readmeFilename":"README.MD","time":{"modified":"2016-06-07T13:33:02.832Z","created":"2016-06-06T21:16:54.154Z","1.0.0":"2016-06-06T21:16:54.154Z","1.0.1":"2016-06-06T22:08:24.228Z","1.0.5":"2016-06-06T23:01:12.300Z","1.0.10":"2016-06-06T23:30:17.936Z","1.0.11":"2016-06-06T23:34:05.603Z","1.0.15":"2016-06-06T23:47:14.434Z","1.0.20":"2016-06-07T13:33:02.832Z"}}}
