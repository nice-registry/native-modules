Please note that currently only the newest database version, called KDBX, is supported. Features include so far:\n\n- **Password and/or Keyfile credentials**: keepass.io supports both of the most common used credential types for KeePass databases.\n- **Powerful API**: This library offers you a powerful API, which even allows you raw access to the database, so even unsupported third-party fields can be modified.\n- **Joyfully simple and flexible**: I've built keepass.io to be easily understandable and a joy to use. It's built with JavaScript and tries to provide a solid foundation for modifying KDBX databases.\n- **Stunning performance**: To further improve performance, keepass.io even includes an optional native library, which will help while performing the key transformations. If your system should not have the *Crypto++ Dev Libraries* installed, it will automatically fallback to the slower Node.js methods.\n\n-\n**Note**: *keepass.io is currently under active development. As such, while this library is well-tested, the API might change at anytime. Consider using it in production applications only if you're comfortable following a changelog and updating your usage accordingly.*\n\n\nExample\n-------\nAs mentioned above, keepass.io is really easy to use. The following example code opens a database, outputs its name, changes the name to *'KeePass.IO rocks!'* and saves the database with new credentials. More examples are available within the *examples* folder.\n\n```javascript\nvar path = require('path');\nvar kpio = require('../lib');\n\nvar db = new kpio.Database();\ndb.addCredential(new kpio.Credentials.Password('thematrix'));\ndb.addCredential(new kpio.Credentials.Keyfile('apoc.key'));\ndb.loadFile(databasePath, function(err) {\n\tif(err) throw err;\n\n\tvar rawDatabase = db.getRawApi().get();\n\tconsole.log('Database name: ' + rawDatabase.KeePassFile.Meta.DatabaseName);\n\trawDatabase.KeePassFile.Meta.DatabaseName = 'KeePass.IO rocks!';\n\n\tdb.resetCredentials();\n\tdb.addCredential(new kpio.Credentials.Password('morpheus'));\n\tdb.addCredential(new kpio.Credentials.Keyfile('trinity.key'));\n\n\tdb.getRawApi().set(rawDatabase);\n\tdb.saveFile(newDatabasePath, function(err) {\n\t\tif(err) throw err;\n\t});\n});\n```\n\n\nCopyright\n---------\nCopyright &copy; 2013-2014 Pascal Mathis.
