Should work with their ICT3K5/ICT3K7 card readers. Will work on Windows and only on 32bit Node.js due to library's limitations.\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\n\n$ npm install sankyo-ict3k\n\n```\n\n## Methods\n\n### .connect(object, callback)\n\nEstablishes connection with the card reader. Object containing port, baud rate fields should be passed to the method. Callback (optional) is executed after finishing connection attempt. Result of the operation is passed to the callback as an argument.\n\n```js\n\n\t// object example\n\t{\n\t\tport: \"COM4\",\n\t\tbaudRate: 115200\n\t}\n\n```\n\n### .exec(object, callback)\n\nSends command to the connected device. Accepts object as an argument. Object contains command, parameter and data (optional) fields. Executes callback (optional) after finishing a command and passes result as an argument.\n\n```js\n\n\t// object example\n\t{\n    \tcommand: 0x30,\n    \tparameter: 0x30,\n    \tdata: [0x33, 0x32, 0x34, 0x31, 0x30, 0x30, 0x31, 0x30, 0x30, 0x30]\n\t}\n\n```\n### .disconnect()\n\nDisconnects from the device.\n\n## Example usage\n\n```js\n\nconst ict3k = require('sankyo-cardreader');\nict3k.connect({port: \"COM4\", baudRate: 115200}, function(res) { // connect to the device\n\tconsole.log(res);\n\tict3k.exec({\n    \tcommand: 0x30,\n    \tparameter: 0x30,\n    \tdata: [0x33, 0x32, 0x34, 0x31, 0x30, 0x30, 0x31, 0x30, 0x30, 0x30]\t// init connection\n\t},function(res) {\n\t\tconsole.log(res);\n\t\tict3k.exec({ // set color green\n    \t    command: 0x35,\n    \t    parameter: 0x31,\n\t\t}, function() {\n\t\t\tict3k.exec({ // set color red\n    \t\t    command: 0x35,\n    \t\t    parameter: 0x32,\n\t\t\t}, function(res) {\n\t\t\t\tconsole.log(res);\n\t\t\t\tict3k.disconnect(); // disconnect device\n\t\t\t});\n\t\t});\n\t});\n});\n\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis is only a wrapper for Sankyo's publicly distributed ICT3K_6240 library.
