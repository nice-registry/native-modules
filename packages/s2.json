S2 has no documentation besides\nsource comments and [this presentation](https://cloudup.com/cVR0jOEufLR).\nNotably it's used for [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/)'s [2dsphere index](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/2dsphere/),\nas well as in [viewfinderco](https://github.com/viewfinderco/viewfinder)'s\n[DynamoDB](http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)-powered database. [s2map.com](http://s2map.com/)\nalso demonstrates one of the killer features of the library, 'coverings', which\nare intelligently computed groups of cells that can be used to index geometries.\n\n## Example\n\n```js\nvar s2 = require('s2');\n\nvar ll = new s2.S2LatLng(0, 0);\nll.isValid(); // true\nvar normalized = ll.normalized(); // true\nvar pt = ll.toPoint();\n```\n\n## Build\n\n    npm install\n    npm build . --build-from-source\n    npm test\n\n## Geojson\n\nnode-s2 is a low level s2 wrapper. If you are simply looking to get geojson into s2, you should check out [geojson-cover](https://github.com/mapbox/geojson-cover).\n\n## [Documentation: API.md](API.md)\n\n## Notes\n\nSome of the S2 API is not wrapped because it isn't meant to be exposed in this way,\nand is blocked from wrapping by [DISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml#Copy_Constructors).\n\n* S2CellUnion\n* S2Loop\n* S2Polyline\n* S2Polygon\n* S2RegionCoverer\n* S2RegionIntersection\n\n## See Also\n\n* [s2-geometry-javascript](https://github.com/jonatkins/s2-geometry-javascript) - an incomplete port of S2 to JavaScript.\n* [gos2](https://code.google.com/p/gos2/) - very incomplete port to Go\n* [viewfinder built a python wrapper](https://github.com/viewfinderco/third_party/blob/master/python-package/s2-0.2.tar.gz)\n* [s2-geometry-php](https://github.com/eelf/s2-geometry-library-php) - another very incomplete port to PHP\n* [interview with david blackman](http://www.fastcolabs.com/3007394/open-company/how-foursquare-building-humane-map-framework-rival-googles)\n","created":"2014-05-06T21:25:58.960Z","modified":"2017-05-22T20:47:42.899Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"tmcw","email":"tom@macwright.org"},"owners":[{"email":"accounts@mapbox.com","name":"mapbox-admin"},{"email":"tom+npm@macwright.org","name":"tmcw"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"s2","_nodeVersion":"4.6.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/s2-0.5.0.tgz_1478556448956_0.8798295287415385"},"_npmUser":{"name":"tmcw","email":"tom@macwright.org"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.8","_rev":"18-cebad5ff60f66e607e87496d567ac268","_shasum":"c63112cee69f3275108c8238bd44eec0a1efef18","author":{"name":"Tom MacWright","email":"tom@macwright.org","url":"http://macwright.org/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mapbox/node-s2/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.5.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"c63112cee69f3275108c8238bd44eec0a1efef18","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/s2/-/s2-0.5.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"email":"accounts@mapbox.com","name":"mapbox-admin"},{"email":"tom+npm@macwright.org","name":"tmcw"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-05-22T20:47:42.899Z","created":"2014-05-06T21:25:58.960Z","0.0.0":"2014-05-06T21:25:58.960Z","0.1.0":"2014-05-07T22:23:59.883Z","0.2.0":"2014-05-09T22:18:20.673Z","0.2.1":"2014-05-12T19:51:11.396Z","0.3.0":"2014-05-12T22:00:26.699Z","0.3.1":"2014-05-20T21:21:17.136Z","0.3.2":"2014-07-22T14:24:09.033Z","0.3.3":"2014-07-22T15:24:09.238Z","0.3.4":"2014-07-22T15:48:48.539Z","0.3.5":"2014-07-23T01:12:27.735Z","0.3.6":"2014-07-23T22:18:38.725Z","0.3.7":"2014-07-23T22:35:02.129Z","0.3.8":"2014-07-28T19:51:17.989Z","0.3.9":"2014-08-06T20:40:29.956Z","0.4.0":"2015-02-22T15:12:56.507Z","0.5.0":"2016-11-07T22:07:29.503Z"}}}
