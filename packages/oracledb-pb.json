It's only external non-npm dependency is the Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime. The module even downloads and installs the necessary Oracle Instant Client Packages for you and adds the folder to your PATH environment variable.\n\noracledb-pb is located within my node-oracledb fork: [easy_pb](https://github.com/bchr02/node-oracledb/tree/easy_pb) which is based on the work of my node-oracledb fork: [prebuild_support](https://github.com/bchr02/node-oracledb/tree/prebuild_support). easy_pb's only differnce is that it has a dependency on [instantclient](https://github.com/bchr02/instantclient), so that upon installation the Oracle Instant Client Packages get installed, and lib/oracledb is modified to add Instant Client to path.\n\n## Install:\nnpm install oracledb-pb\n\n## Use:\nvar oracledb = require('oracledb-pb');\n\n\n*Disclaimer: For small projects, testing or rapid prototyping I recommend oracledb-pb but for anything large scale or something that you will be publishing to npm I don't recommend it. The main reason is because it is not officially supported by Oracle and another reason is because I can't make any guarantees as to how frequently or how long term I can maintain it. Although, I do plan to automate the publishing of upstream node-oracledb changes which should significantly reduce the maintaince needed.* \n","created":"2017-01-06T19:25:40.165Z","modified":"2017-01-06T22:27:17.706Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"bchr02","email":"billchristo@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"bchr02","email":"billchristo@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"oracledb-pb","_nodeVersion":"7.4.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/oracledb-pb-1.12.3.tgz_1483741637041_0.9066958648618311"},"_npmUser":{"name":"bchr02","email":"billchristo@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.0.5","_rev":"3-10dd39be6f5a934944090ee663189766","_shasum":"891e6132f874cddeca9fac29b2bf80864ca94d38","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/bchr02/node-oracledb/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.12.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"891e6132f874cddeca9fac29b2bf80864ca94d38","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/oracledb-pb/-/oracledb-pb-1.12.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"bchr02","email":"billchristo@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-01-06T22:27:17.706Z","created":"2017-01-06T19:25:40.165Z","1.12.2":"2017-01-06T19:25:40.165Z","1.12.2-pb0.0.1":"2017-01-06T22:13:50.740Z","1.12.3":"2017-01-06T22:27:17.706Z"}}}
