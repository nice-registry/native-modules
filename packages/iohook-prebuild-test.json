There is example:  \n\n```javascript\n'use strict';\nconst ioHook = require('iohook');\n\nioHook.on(\"mousemove\", event => {\n  console.log(event);\n  /* You get object like this\n    {\n      type: 'mousemove',\n      x: 700,\n      y: 400\n    }\n   */\n});\n\n//Register and start hook\nioHook.start();\n```\nIf type ```ioHook.start(true);``` you can enable debug logger in native lib. Use it if you have troubles with this module\n\n\n### Available events\n\n### keypress\nCalls when user press and release a key. Event contain next object:  \n`{keychar: 'f', keycode: 19, rawcode: 15, type: 'keypress'}`\n\n### keydown\nCalls when user press a key. Event contain next object:  \n`{ keychar: 'd', keycode: 46, rawcode: 8, type: 'keydown' }`\n\n### keyup\nCalls when user release a key. Event contain next object:  \n`{keychar: 'f', keycode: 19, rawcode: 15, type: 'keup'}`\n\n### mouseclick\nCalls when user click mouse button. Event contain next object:  \n`{ button: 1, clicks: 1, x: 545, y: 696, type: 'mouseclick' }`\n\n### mousedown\nCalls when user press and release a key. Event contain next object:  \n`{ button: 1, clicks: 1, x: 545, y: 696, type: 'mousedown' }`\n\n### mouseup\nCalls when user press and release a key. Event contain next object:  \n`{ button: 1, clicks: 1, x: 545, y: 696, type: 'mouseup' }`\n\n### mousemove\nCalls when user press and release a key. Event contain next object:  \n`{ button: 0, clicks: 0, x: 521, y: 737, type: 'mousemove' }`\n\n### mousedrag\nCalls when user press and release a key. Event contain next object:  \n`{ button: 0, clicks: 0, x: 373, y: 683, type: 'mousedrag' }`\n\n### mousewheel\nCalls when user press and release a key. Event contain next object:  \n`{ amount: 3, clicks: 1, direction: 3, rotation: 1, type: 'mousewheel', x: 466, y: 683 }`\n\n## Known issues\nIn some cases, most often when you make mouse moves or keyboard events very fast,\nmodule crash with \"Segmentation fault: 11\". Looks like it is problem in my native implementation,\nbut I still can't find a problem. Will be happy if somebody helps with it.\n\n## Credits\nThanks for libuiohook project!\n","created":"2017-03-23T05:24:06.312Z","modified":"2017-03-23T21:16:40.801Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"vespakoen","email":"k.schmeets@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"vespakoen","email":"k.schmeets@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"iohook-prebuild-test","_nodeVersion":"6.10.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/iohook-prebuild-test-0.1.16.tgz_1490303800172_0.8133840768132359"},"_npmUser":{"name":"vespakoen","email":"k.schmeets@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.10","_rev":"14-8f2255e09acb896db319d5fe79709fb7","_shasum":"f89d75caafb8b86caa73ccc1f6fd271dca693cd7","author":{"name":"Aloyan Dmitry"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/WilixLead/iohook/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.16"},"dist":{"shasum":"f89d75caafb8b86caa73ccc1f6fd271dca693cd7","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/iohook-prebuild-test/-/iohook-prebuild-test-0.1.16.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"vespakoen","email":"k.schmeets@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-03-23T21:16:40.801Z","created":"2017-03-23T05:24:06.312Z","0.1.3":"2017-03-23T05:24:06.312Z","0.1.4":"2017-03-23T05:43:34.666Z","0.1.5":"2017-03-23T07:18:38.649Z","0.1.6":"2017-03-23T07:24:06.462Z","0.1.7":"2017-03-23T07:31:44.551Z","0.1.8":"2017-03-23T14:37:00.447Z","0.1.9":"2017-03-23T14:59:17.685Z","0.1.10":"2017-03-23T15:12:06.344Z","0.1.11":"2017-03-23T15:58:26.706Z","0.1.12":"2017-03-23T17:11:22.373Z","0.1.13":"2017-03-23T17:16:59.989Z","0.1.14":"2017-03-23T19:45:00.044Z","0.1.15":"2017-03-23T20:06:07.633Z","0.1.16":"2017-03-23T21:16:40.801Z"}}}
