The main feature is [single row mode](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/libpq-single-row-mode.html) to support massive result sets without consuming the entire result set into memory. [node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres) is the standard postgres library, but it requires the entire result set to be read into memory before processing it. There is also [pg-cursor](https://github.com/brianc/node-pg-cursor) on top of it, which helps, but it relies on server-side cursors (portals) which aren't compatible in all scenarios where session-level postgres features don't work (e.g. a production system running pgbouncer connection pooling).\n\nThis is not a fully functional postgres client, but it could be one day. It's still in early development.\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install minipg\n```\n\n## Example\n\n```js\nimport { Client } from 'minipg';\n\nconst client = new Client().connect('dbname = postgres');\n\nconst sql = 'SELECT generate_series(1, 4000000000)';\n\n// query an essentially infinite series of results\nclient.query(sql).each(function(err, finished, columns, row, index) {\n  // `err` is a possible error message\n  // `finished` indicates that the iteration is complete\n  // `columns` an object containing the column definitions\n  // `row` is the row object with the row data in it\n  // `index` is the index of this row in the result set\n  console.log(index);\n\n  if (finished) {\n    // the end was reached\n    client.close();\n  }\n});\n```\n","created":"2015-12-21T04:31:20.739Z","modified":"2017-04-19T17:56:05.555Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"zhm","email":"zac.mccormick@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"zhm","email":"zac.mccormick@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"minipg","_nodeVersion":"7.7.2","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/minipg-0.3.1.tgz_1492624564912_0.5281573263928294"},"_npmUser":{"name":"zhm","email":"zac.mccormick@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.1.2","_rev":"7-e79328630818c5927e7532765721ba05","_shasum":"7beb1324b7fdefa35108850fe0ff4704a43bc275","author":{"name":"Zac McCormick","email":"zac.mccormick@gmail.com","url":"http://github.com/zhm"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/zhm/minipg/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.3.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"7beb1324b7fdefa35108850fe0ff4704a43bc275","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/minipg/-/minipg-0.3.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"zhm","email":"zac.mccormick@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-04-19T17:56:05.555Z","created":"2015-12-21T04:31:20.739Z","0.0.1":"2015-12-21T04:31:20.739Z","0.0.2":"2015-12-21T05:16:03.118Z","0.0.3":"2015-12-21T18:45:59.034Z","0.0.4":"2015-12-22T04:00:37.946Z","0.0.5":"2015-12-22T04:19:58.958Z","0.0.6":"2015-12-22T04:28:54.040Z","0.0.7":"2016-01-07T21:31:52.138Z","0.0.8":"2016-01-08T00:24:35.210Z","0.0.9":"2016-01-08T03:26:41.040Z","0.0.10":"2016-03-31T22:48:43.477Z","0.0.11":"2016-05-18T13:27:08.095Z","0.0.12":"2016-05-18T22:21:04.898Z","0.0.13":"2016-05-19T13:55:14.074Z","0.0.14":"2016-05-26T17:17:53.922Z","0.0.15":"2016-05-26T23:04:04.480Z","0.0.16":"2016-06-03T15:25:15.277Z","0.0.17":"2016-06-11T19:29:10.504Z","0.0.18":"2016-06-15T14:34:44.504Z","0.0.19":"2016-06-15T17:17:00.453Z","0.0.20":"2016-06-15T20:36:59.875Z","0.0.21":"2016-06-15T21:01:40.109Z","0.0.22":"2016-06-15T21:04:55.720Z","0.0.23":"2016-06-15T22:07:15.314Z","0.0.24":"2016-06-28T17:52:18.979Z","0.0.25":"2016-06-28T20:06:45.061Z","0.1.0":"2016-07-04T00:21:26.019Z","0.2.0":"2017-03-18T18:49:38.155Z","0.2.1":"2017-03-18T19:35:28.903Z","0.2.2":"2017-03-18T22:46:12.607Z","0.2.3":"2017-03-19T15:55:16.258Z","0.3.0":"2017-04-05T18:25:08.642Z","0.3.1":"2017-04-19T17:56:05.555Z"}}}
