If you don't do this, they could remain zombies for ever!\n\nYou should implement a blocking loop in your application in order to wait for a child process. You should do this asyncronously by passing `WNOHANG` as an option and using a timeout to call `waitpid` until the PID returned is `0` (no child process state changes left). Don't let the `waitpid` call block the whole thread.\n\nStarting from version 2.0.0 fixed to use the latest node addon/v8 API.\n\n## building binary\n\nIf a binary is available it will be installed using `node-pre-gyp`.
