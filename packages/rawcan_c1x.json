SocketCAN is a socket based implementation of the CAN bus protocol for the Linux kernel, developed primarily by VW.\n\n```javascript\nimport * as can from 'rawcan';\n\nconst socket = can.createSocket('vcan0');\n\nsocket.on('error', err => { console.log('socket error: ' + err); });\nsocket.on('message', (id, buffer) => {\n  console.log('received frame [' + id.toString(16) + '] ' + buffer.toString('hex'));\n});\n\nsocket.send(can.EFF_FLAG | 0x23c89f, 'hello');\n```\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nThis package is published to npm, so installing is as simple as:\n\n```\n$ npm install rawcan\n```\n\nTypescript bindings are included, so Typescript should just work.\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nThe workflow is mostly standard for a node addon. There is a native component, so a c++ compiler and make are required. In Ubuntu these dependencies can be installed by running the following in your shell\n\n```\n$ sudo aptitude install build-essential\n```\n\nAfter you have cloned the repo, run the following to install the npm dependencies and build the code:\n\n```\n$ npm install\n$ npm run build\n```\n\nRunning the tests requires a virtual CAN network interface called vcan0.\n\n```\n$ sudo modprobe vcan\n$ sudo ip link add type vcan\n$ sudo ip link set vcan0 up\n```\n\nThen the tests can be run with npm\n\n```\n$ npm test\n```\n\nHow is this different from node-can?\n------------------------------------\n\nThere is another node package for SocketCAN called [node-can](https://github.com/sebi2k1/node-can) (socketcan in npm). The main difference is that node-can is not evented- sends are synchronous and receives are done on a separate thread. By contrast, this package ties into the libuv based node event system, which uses epoll under the hood. node-can also has some messaging features, while this package is strictly a thin wrapper around raw CAN sockets.\n","created":"2016-06-10T13:45:23.948Z","modified":"2016-06-10T13:45:23.948Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"ploto","email":"ploto_zhu@aliyun.com"},"owners":[{"name":"ploto","email":"ploto_zhu@aliyun.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"rawcan_c1x","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/rawcan_c1x-1.1.4.tgz_1465566321437_0.88763543125242"},"_npmUser":{"name":"ploto","email":"ploto_zhu@aliyun.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.28","_rev":"1-e849ec3ba7196f4c250c2aee0c2e5798","_shasum":"6b3c75a46241f7bef3581216d5ab6a3c77d5eb81","author":{"name":"ploto_zhu@aliyun.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/plotozhu/rawcan.git"},"directories":{"test":"test"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.1.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"6b3c75a46241f7bef3581216d5ab6a3c77d5eb81","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/rawcan_c1x/-/rawcan_c1x-1.1.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"ploto","email":"ploto_zhu@aliyun.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-06-10T13:45:23.948Z","created":"2016-06-10T13:45:23.948Z","1.1.4":"2016-06-10T13:45:23.948Z"}}}
