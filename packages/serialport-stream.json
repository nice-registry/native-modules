Streams all the way.\n\n## Compatibility\n\n  This is currently implemented with a POSIX-only native binding.\n  If you'd want to implement [Windows compat](https://github.com/nathan7/serialport-stream/issues/1), that'd rock.\n\n","created":"2013-11-10T23:23:18.516Z","modified":"2017-03-22T22:59:25.399Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"nathan7","email":"nathan@nathan7.eu"},"owners":[],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"serialport-stream","_nodeVersion":"4.2.3","_npmUser":{"name":"nathan7","email":"nathan@nathan7.eu"},"_npmVersion":"3.5.0","_rev":"2-f2b704482b22a129075c3985afcf2ee2","_shasum":"41308609a83428d52716f25670503fb0769f6ad3","author":{"name":"Nathan Zadoks"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/nathan7/serialport-stream/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.1.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"41308609a83428d52716f25670503fb0769f6ad3","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/serialport-stream/-/serialport-stream-1.1.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-03-22T22:59:25.399Z","created":"2013-11-10T23:23:18.516Z","0.0.0":"2013-11-10T23:23:21.559Z","0.0.1":"2013-11-10T23:25:53.444Z","0.0.2":"2013-11-10T23:32:13.271Z","0.1.0":"2013-11-11T00:22:58.131Z","0.2.0":"2013-11-11T01:09:55.196Z","1.0.0":"2013-11-11T14:18:57.741Z","1.0.1":"2013-11-12T14:03:19.126Z","1.0.2":"2013-11-13T18:19:58.541Z","1.0.3":"2015-08-11T22:05:50.849Z","1.1.0":"2015-12-24T13:01:34.595Z"}}}
