Rust source files go in `src` as usual and Node source files go wherever you like, such as the root directory or the `lib` directory:\n\n```\n├── package.json\n├── Cargo.toml\n├── src/\n└── lib/\n```\n\n## package.json\n\nYou should have `rust-bindings` in your dependencies, and a `postinstall` script set to run `rust-bindings build`. This will ensure that the necessary project boilerplate (the `binding.gyp` build manifest and top-level C++ addon file) are generated before publishing.\n```json\n  ...\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"rust-bindings\": \"0.0.6\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"postinstall\": \"rust-bindings build\"\n  }\n  ...\n```\n\nIf you want a debug build, change the `postinstall` command to `\"rust-bindings build --debug\"`.\n\n## Building\n\nBuild your native module simply by running `npm install` from the project directory.\n\nClients who depend on your native module, directly or indirectly, don't have to do anything special. (However, they do have to have the required build tools installed on their machine. Hopefully we can improve this situation in the future.)\n\n## Requiring\n\nYou can easily require your native module from JS without having to specify the build directory; `rust-bindings` figures this out for you:\n\n```javascript\nvar my_native_module = require('rust-bindings')();\n```\n\nYou can override defaults by passing an optional options object to the `rust-bindings` module:\n\n| Option    | Description   | Type     | Default                                                                  |\n| --------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| root      | project root  | string   | nearest containing directory of caller with package.json or node_modules |\n| name      | library name  | string   | parse($manifest).package.name                                            |\n| manifest  | manifest path | path     | $root/Cargo.toml                                                         |\n\n\n# Setup\n\n**Note: this is currently only working on OS X.**\n\n### OS X\n\n* [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/)\n* Node: io.js v3 or later. I recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script):\n\n```\n% nvm install iojs\n```\n\n* [multirust](https://github.com/brson/multirust#quick-installation)\n\n*Right now multirust is a mandatory dependency because it's used to run on Rust nightly by default. Once the [fix for a jemalloc linking bug](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/27400) makes it through the trains to stable, multirust will be an optional dependency and rust-bindings will default to the system Rust compiler.*\n\n\n# Known Limitations\n\n* I've only gotten this working on OS X with io.js >= 3.\n* It would be ideal to make Rust available as npm packages, to avoid clients of a native module having to install Rust on their system.\n* There's no way to fallback on [precompiled](https://github.com/mapbox/node-pre-gyp) or [portable](http://insertafter.com/en/blog/native-node-module.html) implementations.\n\nI would love to work with people on fixing these limitations!\n\n\n# License\n\nMIT\n","created":"2015-09-19T08:21:50.325Z","modified":"2015-12-17T20:55:25.134Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"dherman","email":"dherman@mozilla.com"},"owners":[{"name":"dherman","email":"dherman@mozilla.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"rust-bindings","_nodeVersion":"4.2.1","_npmUser":{"name":"dherman","email":"dherman@mozilla.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.7","_rev":"1-d8a5ec7077eba3b818010bbeab1c89d8","_shasum":"132f836e336b65c3bd929f7404c7f2ec6bb58a2e","author":{"name":"Dave Herman","email":"dherman@mozilla.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/dherman/rust-bindings/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.9"},"dist":{"shasum":"132f836e336b65c3bd929f7404c7f2ec6bb58a2e","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/rust-bindings/-/rust-bindings-0.0.9.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"dherman","email":"dherman@mozilla.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-12-17T20:55:25.134Z","created":"2015-09-19T08:21:50.325Z","0.0.1":"2015-09-19T08:21:50.325Z","0.0.2":"2015-09-19T17:54:49.781Z","0.0.3":"2015-09-20T04:36:22.637Z","0.0.4":"2015-09-21T23:48:17.731Z","0.0.5":"2015-10-02T00:01:17.693Z","0.0.6":"2015-10-08T16:02:01.684Z","0.0.7":"2015-11-12T07:51:47.553Z","0.0.8":"2015-12-17T19:16:35.514Z","0.0.9":"2015-12-17T20:55:25.134Z"}}}
