It is among the best compressors out there according to several benchmarks:\n* [Gzip vs Bzip2 vs LZMA vs XZ vs LZ4 vs LZO](http://pokecraft.first-world.info/wiki/Quick_Benchmark:_Gzip_vs_Bzip2_vs_LZMA_vs_XZ_vs_LZ4_vs_LZO)\n* [Large Text Compression Benchmark](http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text.html#2118)\n* [Linux Compression Comparison (GZIP vs BZIP2 vs LZMA vs ZIP vs Compress)](http://bashitout.com/2009/08/30/Linux-Compression-Comparison-GZIP-vs-BZIP2-vs-LZMA-vs-ZIP-vs-Compress.html)\n\nIt has a good balance between compression time/ratio and decompression time/memory.\n\n# About this project\n\nThis project aims towards providing:\n* A quick and easy way to play with XZ compression:\nQuick and easy as it conforms to zlib API, so that switching from __zlib/deflate__ to __xz__ might be as easy as a string search/replace in your code editor :smile:\n\n* Complete integration with XZ sources/binaries:\nYou can either use system packages or download a specific version and compile it!\nSee [installation](#installation) below.\n\n> Worth noting, only LZMA2 is supported for compression output. But the library can open and read any LZMA1 or LZMA2 compressed file and possibly others...\n\n# What's new ?\n\nSupports all NodeJS versions, thanks to [nan](https://github.com/nodejs/nan) !\nIt has been tested and works on:\n- Linux x64 (Ubuntu)\n- OSX (tested with Travis)\n- Raspberry Pi 2 (armv7l 32-bits)\n- Raspberry Pi 3 (but still a 32 bits Raspbian)\n- Windows (ongoing tests)\n\n# Related projects\n\nThanks to the community, there are several choices out there:\n* [lzma-purejs](https://github.com/cscott/lzma-purejs)\nA pure JavaScript implementation of the algorithm\n* [node-xz](https://github.com/robey/node-xz)\nNode binding of XZ library\n* [lzma-native](https://github.com/addaleax/lzma-native)\nA very complete implementation of XZ library bindings\n* Others are also available but they fork \"xz\" process in the background.\n\n# API comparison\n\n```js\nvar lzma = require('lzma');\n```\n\nZlib            | XZlib                   | Arguments\n----------------|-------------------------|---------------\ncreateGzip      | createXz                | ([lzma_options, [options]])\ncreateGunzip    | createUnxz              | ([lzma_options, [options]])\ngzip            | xz                      | (buf, [options], callback)\ngunzip          | unxz                    | (buf, [options], callback)\ngzipSync        | xzSync                  | (buf, [options])\ngunzipSync      | unxzSync                | (buf, [options])\n\n## Constants\n\n`options` is an `Object` with the following possible attributes:\n\nAttribute            | Type     | Available options\n---------------------|----------|------------\ncheck                | Uint32   | NONE\n | |CRC32\n | |CRC64\n | |SHA256\npreset | Uint32 | DEFAULT\n | |EXTREME\nflag | Uint32 | TELL_NO_CHECK\n | |TELL_UNSUPPORTED_CHECK\n | |TELL_ANY_CHECK\n | |CONCATENATED\nmode | Uint32 | FAST\n | |NORMAL\nfilters | Array | LZMA2 (added by default)\n | |X86\n | |POWERPC\n | |IA64\n | |ARM\n | |ARMTHUMB\n | |SPARC\n\nFor further information about each of these flags, you will find reference at [XZ SDK](http://7-zip.org/sdk.html).\n\n# Installation\n\nWell, as simple as this one-liner:\n\n```sh\n$ npm i node-liblzma --save\n```\n\nIf you want to enable threading support in the module, then opt in with:\n\n``` bash\n$ ENABLE_MT=1 npm install liblzma --save\n```\n\n> This will of course work only if you have a binary version of liblzma with threading enabled.\nIf this is not the case, it will not fail (even at runtime). It justs won't work.\nTo check if this is enabled or not, run the [tests suite](#tests)\n\nIn both cases, it will try to download an existing pre-compiled module binary and if none exists it will build it.\n\nTo build the module, you have the following options:\n1. Using system development libraries\n2. Download and compile `xz`, and statically link against node module\n3. Compile `xz` yourself, outside `node-liblzma` and build node module with dynamically linked library\n\n## Using system dev libraries to compile\n\nYou need to have the development package installed on your system. If you have Debian based distro:\n\n```\n# apt-get install liblzma-dev\n```\n\n## Compile and statically link `xz`\n\nIf you do not plan on having a local install, you can ask for automatic download and build of whatever version of `xz` you want.\nWith the use of [UBS](https://github.com/oorabona/ubs), you do not need to download/configure/install `xz` yourself anymore.\n\nJust do:\n\n```sh\n$ COMPILE=1 npm install --save node-liblzma\n```\n\nWhen no option is given in the commandline arguments, it will build with default values.\n\nIf you want to build __experimental__ multi-threading feature, you can build `xz` with threads enabled just for this library by running:\n\n```sh\n$ ENABLE_MT=1 COMPILE=1 npm install --save node-liblzma\n```\n\n## Local install of `xz` sources (outside `node-liblzma`)\n\nSo you did install `xz` somewhere outside the module and want the module to use it.\n\nFor that, you need to set the include directory and library directory search paths as GCC [environment variables](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Environment-Variables.html).\n\n```sh\n$ export CPATH=$HOME/path/to/headers\n$ export LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/path/to/lib\n$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/path/to/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n```\n\nThe latest is needed for tests to be run right after.\n\nOnce done, a simple should suffice:\n\n```sh\n$ npm install\n```\n\n# Tests\n\nYou can run tests with:\n\n```sh\n$ npm test\n```\n\nIt will build and launch tests suite with [Mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha).\n\n# Usage\n\nAs the API is very close to NodeJS Zlib, you will probably find a good reference\n[there](http://www.nodejs.org/api/zlib.html).\n\nOtherwise examples can be found as part of the test suite, so feel free to use them!\nThey are written in [CoffeeScript](http://www.coffeescript.org).\n\n# Bugs\n\nIf you find one, feel free to contribute and post a new issue!\nPR are accepted as well :)\n\nKudos goes to [addaleax](https://github.com/addaleax) for helping me out with C++ stuff !\n\nIf you compile with threads, you may see a bunch of warnings about `-Wmissing-field-initializers`.\nThis is _normal_ and does not prevent threading from being active and working.\nI did not yet figure how to fix this except by masking the warning..\n\n# License\n\nThis software is released under LGPL3.0+\n","starsCount":2,"created":"2014-10-12T20:57:58.598Z","modified":"2016-06-16T01:52:03.797Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"oorabona","email":"olivier.orabona@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"oorabona","email":"olivier.orabona@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"node-liblzma","_nodeVersion":"6.2.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/node-liblzma-1.0.4-12.tgz_1466041921142_0.4318507416173816"},"_npmUser":{"name":"oorabona","email":"olivier.orabona@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.9.3","_rev":"1-d0ab12ba2a41e10ca2866e5f1f0d3de9","_shasum":"668e13c426f424503417b42c18f576c8b7a21817","author":{"name":"Olivier ORABONA"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/oorabona/node-liblzma/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.4-12"},"dist":{"shasum":"668e13c426f424503417b42c18f576c8b7a21817","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/node-liblzma/-/node-liblzma-1.0.4-12.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"oorabona","email":"olivier.orabona@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-06-16T01:52:03.797Z","created":"2014-10-12T20:57:58.598Z","0.3.0":"2014-10-12T20:57:58.598Z","0.4.0":"2014-12-12T17:51:43.340Z","0.4.1-rc1":"2014-12-13T03:11:40.168Z","0.4.1-rc2":"2014-12-13T03:23:15.119Z","0.4.1-rc3":"2014-12-13T03:26:28.593Z","0.4.1-rc4":"2014-12-13T16:02:52.323Z","0.4.1-rc5":"2014-12-13T16:05:34.703Z","0.4.1-rc6":"2014-12-13T16:07:56.753Z","0.4.1-rc7":"2014-12-13T16:09:39.208Z","0.4.1-rc8":"2014-12-13T16:17:24.233Z","0.4.1-rc10":"2014-12-16T00:13:07.470Z","0.4.1-rc11":"2014-12-16T00:19:04.434Z","0.4.2":"2014-12-16T01:03:50.742Z","0.4.3":"2014-12-22T03:37:05.403Z","0.4.4":"2014-12-22T13:56:20.923Z","0.4.5":"2015-03-13T21:38:13.726Z","0.4.5-1":"2015-03-13T21:45:36.346Z","0.5.0":"2015-10-26T09:43:30.124Z","1.0.0":"2015-10-28T03:59:24.783Z","1.0.1":"2015-10-28T04:03:33.013Z","1.0.2":"2015-10-31T17:41:11.229Z","1.0.3":"2016-06-11T03:15:58.767Z","1.0.4":"2016-06-13T23:01:41.273Z","1.0.4-1":"2016-06-14T00:36:09.284Z","1.0.4-2":"2016-06-14T00:50:55.411Z","1.0.4-3":"2016-06-14T00:58:07.434Z","1.0.4-4":"2016-06-14T22:13:20.750Z","1.0.4-5":"2016-06-15T19:29:55.649Z","1.0.4-6":"2016-06-15T21:58:20.341Z","1.0.4-7":"2016-06-15T23:45:41.394Z","1.0.4-8":"2016-06-16T00:06:28.277Z","1.0.4-9":"2016-06-16T00:24:22.442Z","1.0.4-10":"2016-06-16T01:24:29.016Z","1.0.4-11":"2016-06-16T01:30:31.775Z","1.0.4-12":"2016-06-16T01:52:03.797Z"},"users":{"oorabona":true,"moimikey":true}}}
