This is significantly faster than the built-in Map, but loses the order of key/value inserts.\n\nAs of 2.0.0, es6-native-map requires node.js 0.12 or later. If you are running node.js 0.10, stick with the 1.x.x line.\n\nAs of 4.0.0, es6-native-map actually implements @@iterator correctly, so you can use all the iterable functions and operators.\n\nTo install, simply:\n\n    npm install es6-native-map\n\nTo use:\n\n    var Map = require('es6-native-map');\n\n    var map = new Map();\n    map.set('key', {value: 'value'});\n    map.set('something', 'else');\n\n    console.log('There are', map.size, 'item(s) in the map');\n\n    iterator = map.entries();\n    item = iterator.next();\n    while (!item.done) {\n        console.log(item.value[0], '=', item.value[1]);\n        item = iterator.next();\n    }\n\nSee the official [ES6 Map documentation](http://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-map-objects)\n\nThis package is made possible because of Grokker, one of the best places to work. If you are a JS developer looking for a new gig, send me an email at &#x5b;'chad', String.fromCharCode(64), 'grokker', String.fromCharCode(0x2e), 'com'&#x5d;.join('').\n","starsCount":2,"created":"2014-08-21T03:47:40.572Z","modified":"2017-03-16T17:34:31.981Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"chad3814","email":"chad@chad-cat-lore-eddie.com"},"owners":[{"name":"chad3814","email":"chad@chad-cat-lore-eddie.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"es6-native-map","_nodeVersion":"6.7.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/es6-native-map-4.0.1.tgz_1489685670135_0.17990801949054003"},"_npmUser":{"name":"chad3814","email":"chad@chad-cat-lore-eddie.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.8","_rev":"2-d4539f41f0f074cc013d57585920ddfe","_shasum":"4d2c9d7bfd425a357a4b701b5d3d8d2cf44c2ea8","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/chad3814/es6-native-map/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"4.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"4d2c9d7bfd425a357a4b701b5d3d8d2cf44c2ea8","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/es6-native-map/-/es6-native-map-4.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"chad3814","email":"chad@chad-cat-lore-eddie.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-03-16T17:34:31.981Z","created":"2014-08-21T03:47:40.572Z","0.1.0":"2014-08-21T03:47:40.572Z","0.1.1":"2014-08-21T03:57:01.223Z","0.5.0":"2014-08-21T05:23:54.096Z","0.6.0":"2014-08-27T01:14:42.480Z","0.7.0":"2014-08-27T01:16:28.023Z","0.7.1":"2014-08-27T19:28:50.742Z","0.8.0":"2014-08-27T21:07:51.662Z","0.8.1":"2014-08-29T16:32:45.005Z","0.8.2":"2014-09-02T22:03:29.565Z","0.9.0":"2014-09-29T05:21:18.918Z","0.9.1":"2014-09-29T16:55:56.972Z","0.9.2":"2014-10-23T02:09:01.445Z","1.0.0":"2015-02-15T23:49:30.751Z","1.0.1":"2015-02-17T17:38:07.027Z","1.0.2":"2015-02-25T17:28:54.917Z","2.0.0":"2015-03-19T17:34:58.216Z","2.0.1":"2015-04-17T15:28:33.874Z","2.0.2":"2015-04-17T15:35:13.941Z","2.0.3":"2015-04-17T16:00:44.719Z","2.0.4":"2015-07-08T15:43:01.727Z","2.0.5":"2015-07-09T20:57:03.325Z","2.0.7":"2015-07-14T23:21:29.657Z","3.0.0":"2015-10-11T17:28:10.523Z","3.0.1":"2015-10-14T19:29:59.540Z","3.1.0":"2015-10-21T16:54:58.447Z","3.3.2":"2015-11-17T16:39:16.743Z","3.3.3":"2015-11-17T16:49:45.360Z","3.4.0":"2015-11-17T17:30:14.943Z","3.4.1":"2015-12-08T00:45:24.644Z","3.5.0":"2015-12-08T18:49:15.915Z","3.5.1":"2015-12-08T20:45:33.363Z","4.0.1":"2017-03-16T17:34:31.981Z"},"users":{"chad3814":true,"nickeljew":true}}}
