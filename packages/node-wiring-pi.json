On Raspbian Jessie, this should be as easy as:\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install wiringpi\n```\n\nSee the [WiringPi](http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/) link for more options and details.\n\nTo install this node module:\n\n```\nnpm install node-wiring-pi\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar wpi = require('node-wiring-pi');\n```\n\n## TODO\n\n* Documentation!\n* Review export constants\n* Add NAN_MODULE_INIT signatures to .h files\n* Update build script - rebuild or configure build?\n* Add devlib / extensions\n* Add wiringPiISR\n* Add util to replace gpio (read config and set pins as root)\n\n\n","created":"2017-01-05T19:04:14.433Z","modified":"2017-01-31T18:50:35.186Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"rsg98","email":"richard.grime@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"rsg98","email":"richard.grime@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"node-wiring-pi","_nodeVersion":"4.4.2","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/node-wiring-pi-0.0.3.tgz_1485888633249_0.927985594375059"},"_npmUser":{"name":"rsg98","email":"richard.grime@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.15.0","_rev":"3-cb3972474df54c0866016789d6888efa","_shasum":"8fac58002e8d2d85d7400c8abce0052e9baa59c5","author":{"name":"Richard Grime","email":"richard.grime@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/rsg98/node-wiring-pi/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"Igor Soarez","email":"igorsoarez@gmail.com"},{"name":"Leandre Gohy","email":"leandre.gohy@hexeo.be"},{"name":"Eugene Ware","email":"eugene@noblesamurai.com"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"8fac58002e8d2d85d7400c8abce0052e9baa59c5","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/node-wiring-pi/-/node-wiring-pi-0.0.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"rsg98","email":"richard.grime@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-01-31T18:50:35.186Z","created":"2017-01-05T19:04:14.433Z","0.0.1":"2017-01-05T19:04:14.433Z","0.0.2":"2017-01-28T19:52:18.744Z","0.0.3":"2017-01-31T18:50:35.186Z"}}}
