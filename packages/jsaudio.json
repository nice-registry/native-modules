That being said,\nthe `JsAudioNative` api directly follows [PortAudio's API](http://portaudio.com/docs/v19-doxydocs/api_overview.html). You can access this by\nrequiring like so `require('jsaudio').JsAudioNative`\n\nUntil the  abstracted API is finalized you can check out the  [examples](https://github.com/JsAudioOrg/jsaudio/tree/master/examples) directory to see usage at it's current state. Also, feel free to look at the JsAudio class in [lib/jsaudio.js](https://github.com/JsAudioOrg/jsaudio/blob/master/lib/jsaudio.js)\nwhich serves as the abstraction API.\n\n### Contributing\n1. Fork it\n2. Create your feature branch (git checkout -b my-new-feature)\n3. Ensure code style is consistent (js-standard for js)\n4. Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Added some feature')\n5. Push to the branch (git push origin my-new-feature)\n6.
