Why? Because it up to 10 times faster than built-in JSON for certain cases.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n$ npm install binny\n```\n\n## Blobs\n\n```js\nBinny.pack([\"a\", \"bb\", \"ccc\"])\n```\n\nwill return:\n\n```\n<Buffer: B1 00 03 00 01 61 00 02 62 62 00 03 63 63 63>\n\nB1 - Version\n00 03 - Number of blocks\n00 01 - Length of next block\n61 - \"a\"\n00 02 - Length of next block\n62 62 - \"bb\"\n00 03 - Length of next block\n63 63 63 - \"ccc\"\n```\n\nNumbers are stored as big-endian uint16.\n\nIn current version Binny can process only arrays of ascii/utf8 strings!\n\n## Perfomance\n\n```sh\n$ npm run benchmark\n```\n\nBinny is slower than JSON for small arrays (less than 5kb), but it rocks for [this kind of data](https://github.com/x25/binny/blob/master/tests/perfomance.js#L31):\n\n```\nBinny.pack: 9933ms\nJSON.stringify: 45553ms\n\nBinny.unpack: 6703ms\nJSON.parse: 38383ms\n\n(faster is better)\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar Binny = require(\"binny\");\n\nvar buffer = Binny.pack([\"array\", \"of\", \"strings\"]);\nvar arr = Binny.unpack(buffer); //[\"array\", \"of\", \"strings\"]\n```\n\n## Tests\n\n```sh\n$ npm test\n```\n\n## License\nMIT\n","created":"2014-06-03T11:35:44.621Z","modified":"2015-05-16T17:58:05.791Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"x25","email":"job@x25.ru"},"owners":[{"name":"x25","email":"job@x25.ru"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"binny","_npmUser":{"name":"x25","email":"job@x25.ru"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.3","_rev":"1-63434c95e9afbc1b57cc6328d2d53423","author":{"name":"x25"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/x25/binny/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.1.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"1a64fc005f5df6be90882b8754720b6fe704b814","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/binny/-/binny-1.1.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"x25","email":"job@x25.ru"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-05-16T17:58:05.791Z","created":"2014-06-03T11:35:44.621Z","0.1.1":"2014-06-03T11:35:44.621Z","0.2.0":"2014-06-03T15:21:17.997Z","0.2.1":"2014-06-03T15:28:00.514Z","0.2.4":"2014-06-04T14:16:02.123Z","1.0.1":"2014-06-04T15:08:59.171Z","1.0.2":"2014-06-13T14:18:47.116Z","1.1.0":"2014-07-21T10:28:46.580Z","1.1.1":"2015-02-08T17:44:37.532Z","1.1.2":"2015-02-08T18:44:21.788Z","1.1.3":"2015-05-16T17:58:05.791Z"}}}
