You need to have compatible interface and and instrument that talks over GPIB. For simple testing you can skip the hardware part as VISA can talk over COM ports, too. \r\n```\r\n> npm install node-nisa\r\n\r\nvar visa = require('nisa');\r\n\r\nvisa.query(\"GPIB0::12::INSTR\", \"*IDN?\", function(err, result) {\r\n // do something\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Etymology\r\nVISA is the name of the library.. merged with node.js it becomes \"nisa\"\r\n## Known limitations and bugs\r\nDue to lack of interest (it works for me) and more importantly lack of knowledgem, the current implementation includes some memory leaks.\r\nThe implemented functions were selected solely to control my current setup. This is not meant to be a complete implementation of VISA interface. API was adapted to my undestanding of node ways to my best efforts.\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nA lot of the code was inspired by (or blatantly copied) from:\r\n- https://github.com/voodootikigod/node-serialport\r\n- https://bitbucket.org/stephenwvickers/node-raw-socket\r\n- http://svn.clifford.at/handicraft/2013/rigol-ds2000-shell/\r\n\r\nRenewed interest was inspired by 7M4MON and forking his ffi implementation (still a viable approach):\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/7m4mon/visa32test\r\n","created":"2015-09-07T16:53:04.750Z","modified":"2015-09-07T16:53:04.750Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"samofab","email":"samo.fabcic@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"samofab","email":"samo.fabcic@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"node-nisa","_nodeVersion":"0.12.6","_npmUser":{"name":"samofab","email":"samo.fabcic@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.11.2","_rev":"1-fe15f7d413e074fef9ed7f60a854def1","_shasum":"4331754efefdb52f5b21a6cba32b59709eb68948","author":{"name":"Samo Fabcic","email":"samo@absint.si"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/samofab/node-nisa/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"4331754efefdb52f5b21a6cba32b59709eb68948","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/node-nisa/-/node-nisa-1.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"samofab","email":"samo.fabcic@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-09-07T16:53:04.750Z","created":"2015-09-07T16:53:04.750Z","1.0.0":"2015-09-07T16:53:04.750Z"}}}
