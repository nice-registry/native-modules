If you have problems with a linked library, it's a known issue.\n    You'll need to link the folder to the missing one.\n\nOnce installed, you can `./examples/browser.js google.com` or any other page, and you might try the _dark theme_ out too:\n\n```sh\n# OSX needs to have the Adwaita theme installed\n# brew install gtk-adwaita-theme\n\n# executable          url         theme\n./examples/browser.js google.com  dark\n```\n\n\n### Experimental platforms\n\nFollowing how to setup the configuration to at least try building this project.\n\n\n#### How to install node 5.x in Ubuntu 16 LTS\nThe setup file might not recognize `xenial` platform.\nIn this case you need to download the file and edit it.\n\n```bash\n# download the file\ncurl -L -O https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_5.x\n\n# edit (use vi or gedit or whatever you like) \ngedit setup_5.x\n\n# find the following line\nDISTRO=$(lsb_release -c -s)\n# and change it to\nDISTRO=jessie\n\n\n# save the file and run the following\ncat setup_5.x | sudo -E bash -\n\n# once done you can\nrm setup_5.x\n```\n\nAt this point you can `apt-get install nodejs` and follow same instructions used for Ubuntu.\n\n\n#### How to build on Windows (experimental)\nMandatory dependency is _[Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx)_ or _Express_ with a C++ compiler (open a new C++ project and install it via IDE if necessary).\n\nThe easiest/tested way to at least try building this repository is within a _MinGW shell_ provided by the [MSYS2 installer](https://msys2.github.io/).\n\nOnce VS and its C++ compiler is available and MSYS2 installed, launch the MinGW shell.\n\n```sh\n# update the system\n# in case of errors, wait for the update to complete\n# then close and open again MingW shell\npacman -Syyu --noconfirm\n\n# install git, gtk3 and extra dependencie\npacman -S --needed --noconfirm git mingw-w64-$(uname -m)-{gtk3,gobject-introspection,pkg-config}\n\n# where to put the repository clone?\n# pick your flder or use ~/oss (Open Source Software)\nmkdir -p ~/oss/\ncd ~/oss\n\n# clone node-gtk there\ngit clone https://github.com/WebReflection/node-gtk\ncd node-gtk\n\n# first run might take a while\nGYP_MSVS_VERSION=2015 npm install\n```\nThe `GYP_MSVS_VERSION` could be 2010, 2012, 2013 or 2015.\nPlease verify [which version you should use](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation)\n\n\n#### Possible issue on MinGW shell\nIn case you are launching the general executable without knowing the correct platform,\nthe binary path might not be available.\n\nIn such case `python` won't be available neither, and you can check via `which python` command.\n\nIf not found, you need to export the platform related binary path:\n\n```sh\n# example for the 32bit version\nexport PATH=\"/mingw32/bin:$PATH\"\nnpm run install\n```\n\nThis should do the trick. You can also check if there is any python at all via `pacman -Qs python`.\n\nPlease remember `python2` is the one needed.\n\n\n#### known issues building on Windows\nRight now there are few gotchas and the build will most likely fail. Please help with a PR if you know how to solve the issue, thank you!\n","starsCount":2,"created":"2015-12-17T12:17:04.533Z","modified":"2017-01-10T12:11:10.154Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"webreflection","email":"andrea.giammarchi@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"webreflection","email":"andrea.giammarchi@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"node-gtk","_nodeVersion":"5.7.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-6-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/node-gtk-0.0.20.tgz_1456585834211_0.8308422239497304"},"_npmUser":{"name":"webreflection","email":"andrea.giammarchi@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.7.5","_rev":"3-5f760492284a6f9175bd40b795ac0ab0","_shasum":"9ad973a9147bc8c4d53217ce317d562aca993373","author":{"name":"Jasper St. Pierre"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/WebReflection/node-gtk/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.20"},"dist":{"shasum":"9ad973a9147bc8c4d53217ce317d562aca993373","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/node-gtk/-/node-gtk-0.0.20.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"webreflection","email":"andrea.giammarchi@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-01-10T12:11:10.154Z","created":"2015-12-17T12:17:04.533Z","0.0.0":"2015-12-17T12:17:04.533Z","0.0.2":"2015-12-17T21:24:56.097Z","0.0.3":"2015-12-17T21:31:24.069Z","0.0.4":"2015-12-17T21:43:33.463Z","0.0.5":"2015-12-17T21:51:56.633Z","0.0.6":"2015-12-17T21:56:40.401Z","0.0.7":"2015-12-17T21:59:51.228Z","0.0.8":"2015-12-17T22:04:31.239Z","0.0.10":"2015-12-17T22:13:10.251Z","0.0.12":"2015-12-17T22:22:24.157Z","0.0.13":"2015-12-17T22:34:54.600Z","0.0.14":"2015-12-17T22:48:34.010Z","0.0.15":"2015-12-17T22:51:46.048Z","0.0.16":"2015-12-20T20:23:03.891Z","0.0.17":"2016-01-11T00:06:48.524Z","0.0.18":"2016-01-13T11:10:58.394Z","0.0.20":"2016-02-27T15:10:37.259Z"},"users":{"hema":true,"kompasim":true}}}
