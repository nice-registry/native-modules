Watch files\nconsistently across Windows, OSX and Linux.\n\n## About\n\n**navelgazer** is a super fast, light weight and simple file watcher. It will only ever emit `change`, `delete` and `rename` events. This library is ideal if you're looking for a stable platform to build your own file watcher.\n\nIf you're looking for a more full featured file watching library, please use [gaze](https://github.com/shama/gaze) instead.\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/navelgazer.png?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/navelgazer/)\n\n## Usage\n\n``` javascript\nvar watch = require('navelgazer');\n\nwatch(filepath, function(err, action, filepath) {\n  // Called when file is changed\n}, function(err, watcher) {\n  // Watcher is ready\n});\n```\n\n## API\n\n#### `navelgazer(filepath, onEventCallback, watcherIsReadyCallback)`\n\nSpecify a `filepath` and `watcherIsReadyCallback(err, watcher)` will be called when the watcher is ready for events. `watcherIsReadyCallback(err, event, filepath, newFilePath)` will be called for each event detected on that file.\n\nEvents emitted are either `change`, `delete`, or `rename`.\n\n#### `navelgazer.mode`\n\n* `auto` will default to native events and fallback to stat polling if `EMFILE` is hit.\n* `watch` will only use native events and just throw `EMFILE` errors if the limit is hit.\n* `poll` will only use stat polling.\n\n#### `navelgazer.closeAll()`\n\nCloses all native and stat polled watchers.\n\n#### `navelgazer.close(filepath, whenClosedCallback)`\n\nCloses a single file watcher by the given `filepath` and calls `whenClosedCallback()` when it is closed.\n\n#### `navelgazer.getWatchedPaths()`\n\nReturns the file paths of every file watch by either native or stat polling.\n\n#### `navelgazer.tick`\n\nTick incrementer for stat poll. If stat polling, please supply an interval at which to check the files. For example:\n\n```js\nsetInterval(navelgazer.tick.bind(navelgazer), 500);\n```\n\nAn interval of `>=500ms` is recommended as stat polling is taxing on the file system.\n\n## Building\n\nPlease see the [Building page in the wiki](https://github.com/shama/navelgazer/wiki/Building).\n\n## Release History\n* 1.1.1 - Add missing build.js script to package.json\n* 1.1.0 - Updates for node v0.11 and io.js 1.0. Add pre-built binaries and many other minor fixes.\n* 1.0.0 - Initial release\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2015 Kyle Robinson Young  \nLicensed under the MIT license.\n\n> Thank you [Bryce](https://github.com/brycebaril) for the naming this library.\n","starsCount":2,"created":"2014-09-28T17:23:45.956Z","modified":"2015-10-03T23:25:51.881Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"joshperry","email":"josh@6bit.com"},"owners":[{"name":"joshperry","email":"josh@6bit.com"},{"name":"shama","email":"kyle@dontkry.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"navelgazer","_nodeVersion":"4.1.1","_npmUser":{"name":"joshperry","email":"josh@6bit.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.4","_rev":"1-4b79f8e14befdd5b4b652d8053f9fddc","_shasum":"f197ffb30cd4e4dadb8fa7bf9ab8e87ac3f7f0b1","author":{"name":"Kyle Robinson Young","email":"kyle@dontkry.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/shama/navelgazer/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.1.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"f197ffb30cd4e4dadb8fa7bf9ab8e87ac3f7f0b1","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/navelgazer/-/navelgazer-1.1.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"joshperry","email":"josh@6bit.com"},{"name":"shama","email":"kyle@dontkry.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-10-03T23:25:51.881Z","created":"2014-09-28T17:23:45.956Z","1.0.0":"2014-09-28T17:23:45.956Z","1.1.0":"2015-01-23T05:13:54.196Z","1.1.1":"2015-01-23T05:16:11.195Z","1.1.2":"2015-10-03T23:25:51.881Z"},"users":{"joshperry":true,"nelix":true}}}
