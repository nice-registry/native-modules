It gathers information that isn't\navailable at the JS layer about the V8 virtual machine and the process health.\nIt comes packaged with the New Relic Agent v2, and there is nothing that needs\nto be done. For Agent v1 you need only to install the module alongside\n[`newrelic`][npm-newrelic].\n\n## Installation\n\n`npm install --save @newrelic/native-metrics`\n\nNote that this is a native module and thus must be compiled to function.\nPre-built binaries are provided for Linux servers running supported versions of\nNode. If you are not using Linux or not using a supported version of Node, you\nwill need to have a compiler installed on the machine where this is to be\ndeployed. See [node-gyp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp#installation)\nfor more information on compiling native addons.\n\nIf you prepare and package deployments on one machine and install them on\nanother, the two machines must have the same operating system and architecture.\nIf they are not, you will need to re-build the native module after deploying in\norder to get the correct binaries.\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar getMetricEmitter = require('@newrelic/native-metrics')\n\nvar emitter = getMetricEmitter()\nif (emitter.gcEnabled) {\n  emitter.on('gc', (gc) => console.log(gc.type + ': ' + gc.duration))\n}\nif (emitter.usageEnabled) {\n  emitter.on('usage', (usage) => console.log(usage))\n}\nif (emitter.loopEnabled) {\n  setInterval(() => {\n    var loopMetrics = emitter.getLoopMetrics()\n    console.log(\"Loop time:\", loopMetrics.loop)\n    console.log(\"IO wait time:\", loopMetrics.ioWait)\n  }, 1000)\n}\n```\n\nThe metric emitter keeps a referenced timer running for its periodic sampling\nevents. For a graceful shutdown of the process call `NativeMetricEmitter#unbind`.\n\n```js\ngetMetricEmitter().unbind() // Process will now close gracefully.\n```\n\nIf you would like to change the period of the sampling, simply unbind and then\ncall `NativeMetricEmitter#bind` with the new period.\n\n```js\nvar emitter = getMetricEmitter({timeout: 15000})\nemitter.unbind()\nemitter.bind(10000) // Samples will now fire once every 10 seconds.\n```\n\n## License\n\nThe New Relic native metrics module is free-to-use, proprietary software. Please\nsee the full license (found in [LICENSE](LICENSE)) for details on its license\nand the licenses of its dependencies.\n\n[npm-newrelic]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/newrelic\n","created":"2017-05-08T17:05:27.790Z","modified":"2017-05-10T00:24:49.439Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"lykkin","email":"bclement01@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"lykkin","email":"bclement01@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"testerino","_nodeVersion":"7.9.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/testerino-2.1.7.tgz_1494375886319_0.8302767749410123"},"_npmUser":{"name":"lykkin","email":"bclement01@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.2.0","_rev":"8-cf88db25d3c3117637546086e9e41bb7","_shasum":"adbe13c43555ced8fb82b61ad55d0b9c59d98ee3","author":{"name":"New Relic Node.js agent team","email":"nodejs@newrelic.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/newrelic/node-native-metrics/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"Natalie Wolfe","email":"nwolfe@newrelic.com","url":"https://newrelic.com"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"2.1.7"},"dist":{"shasum":"adbe13c43555ced8fb82b61ad55d0b9c59d98ee3","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/testerino/-/testerino-2.1.7.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"lykkin","email":"bclement01@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-05-10T00:24:49.439Z","created":"2017-05-08T17:05:27.790Z","2.1.1":"2017-05-08T17:05:27.790Z","2.1.2":"2017-05-09T22:27:17.383Z","2.1.3":"2017-05-09T23:04:44.436Z","2.1.4":"2017-05-09T23:50:54.432Z","2.1.5":"2017-05-09T23:52:15.692Z","2.1.6":"2017-05-10T00:24:13.203Z","2.1.7":"2017-05-10T00:24:49.439Z"}}}
