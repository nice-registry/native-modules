This adds content to the \"samples\" field of heap snapshots and allows for determining when objects where allocated.\n\n## usage\n\nThis must be used in conjunction with `--track-heap-objects` or the corresponding C++ call. Otherwise it will cause a segfault.\n\n```javascript\nrequire('heapdump-sample').sample();\n```\n\n### starting and stopping tracking\n\nThe module exports functions to start and stop object tracking for convenience.\n\n```javascript\nheapdump_sample.startTrackingHeapObjects(bool_should_trace_allocation_stacks);\nheapdump_sample.stopTrackingHeapObjects();\n```\n\nTracing allocation stacks can be memory intensive, it should not be used indefinitely. For production purposes you should not run tracking at all times, instead turn it on temporarily when you are debugging behavior.\n\n## output to fd\n\nThere is the ability to get data out of the samples in real time by providing an FD to work with.\n\n```javascript\nrequire('heapdump-sample').sample(process.stdout.fd);\n```\n\nThe sample will be available in the JSON representation of a heap snapshot (available via the [heapdump](https://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-heapdump) module).\n\n## require flag usage\n\nUse `-r heapdump-sample/register` to get samples on an interval.\n\nThe interval defaults to 50 milliseconds, and can be changed by setting the `NODE_HEAPDUMP_SAMPLE_RATE` environment variable.\n","created":"2015-11-27T15:18:36.539Z","modified":"2015-12-02T00:59:03.493Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"bradleymeck","email":"bradley.meck@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"bradleymeck","email":"bradley.meck@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"heapdump-sample","_nodeVersion":"4.2.2","_npmUser":{"name":"bradleymeck","email":"bradley.meck@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.7","_rev":"1-ec73b0f261bfaf866354f9c31f628e22","_shasum":"726a2c10278b6e195eafdf1cce9ebfd6e8568ec9","author":{"name":"bradleymeck"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/bmeck/heapdump-sample/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.1.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"726a2c10278b6e195eafdf1cce9ebfd6e8568ec9","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/heapdump-sample/-/heapdump-sample-1.1.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"bradleymeck","email":"bradley.meck@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-12-02T00:59:03.493Z","created":"2015-11-27T15:18:36.539Z","1.0.0":"2015-11-27T15:18:36.539Z","1.0.1":"2015-11-30T15:59:07.236Z","1.1.0":"2015-12-02T00:48:37.009Z","1.1.1":"2015-12-02T00:59:03.493Z"}}}
