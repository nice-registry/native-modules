Unfortunately this means we have to provide our own key layouts but since we can talk directly with the hardware this should work regardless of which state the rest of the system is in.\n\n## Usage example\n{{example.js}}\nThis example uses the swedish.json file as the key layout and will write the users input to stdout.\n\n## makeKeylayout.js\nBy running the command\n```\nnode makeKeylayout.js yourlanguage.json\n```\nAnd then using the console you are running it in to read what keys are pressed you can create your own language key layout. In this case it would create yourlanguage.json\n\n## Installation\nvia npm\n```\nnpm install osx-keylogger\n```\n\n## Tests\nSorry, I didn't feel like it. It's a POC\n\n## Why?\nI couldn't find a decent opensource keylogger for a modern version of OS X and I was looking for an excuse to try out native bindings.\n\n## License\nMIT, see LICENSE file\n","created":"2017-07-09T13:21:19.138Z","modified":"2017-07-09T14:46:25.175Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"justzisguy","email":"magnus.weinberg@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"justzisguy","email":"magnus.weinberg@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"osx-keylogger","_nodeVersion":"8.0.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/osx-keylogger-1.0.1.tgz_1499611584199_0.1146448238287121"},"_npmUser":{"name":"justzisguy","email":"magnus.weinberg@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"5.0.0","_rev":"2-97f241c233eb22ea98ace3b6470dae52","author":{"name":"Magnus Weinberg","email":"magnus.weinberg@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/JustZisGuy/osx-keylogger/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.1"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-jyr4oRAmCs23F9WRaq3sFj27MYdKwtFjjI1V9IY/MtI3RlyZOxmTDfXkCmVbl7w7yMHphZLvzlLXP5yLE+8eaw==","shasum":"cb80fcebd94fcc2203655b38946b6466bf57499f","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/osx-keylogger/-/osx-keylogger-1.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"justzisguy","email":"magnus.weinberg@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.librarity.md","time":{"modified":"2017-07-09T14:46:25.175Z","created":"2017-07-09T13:21:19.138Z","1.0.0":"2017-07-09T13:21:19.138Z","1.0.1":"2017-07-09T14:46:25.175Z"}}}
