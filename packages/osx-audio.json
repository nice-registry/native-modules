Only input is\nsupported so far.\n\nAudio captured is Signed 16-bit PCM, Stereo, 44100Hz, in little-endian\nbyte-order. Alternate capture modes will be supported in future versions.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the module for use in your projects:\n\n```bash\nnpm install osx-audio\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nPipe input to a writeable file stream:\n\n```js\nvar fs = require('fs');\nvar audio = require('osx-audio');\n\nvar input = new audio.Input();\n\nvar writable = fs.createWriteStream('output.wav');\ninput.pipe(writable);\n```\n\n### Options\n\nNone yet.\n\n### API\n\n#### audio.Input()\n\nCreates a readable stream from the system audio's selected input.\n\n## Environment Variables\n\nNone yet.\n\n## Known Issues\n\n- Opening, closing, then opening an input will fail to open. Re-instantiating\n  works fine.\n\n## Contributing\n\nFeel free to send pull requests! I'm not picky, but would like the following:\n\n1. Write tests for any new features, and do not break existing tests.\n2. Be sure to point out any changes that break API.\n\n## History\n\n- **v1.0.0**  \nPorts native bindings to [nan][], newly supporting the latest Node.js versions.\nHuge thanks to [Alexander Kuznetsov][alexkuz] for this contribution!\n\n- **v0.2.0**  \nReimplements streams (again) and fixes stuttering bugs. Exposes audio event\nemitter directly if you wanted to use it.\n\n- **v0.1.0**  \nReimplement streams and change API.\n\n- **v0.0.2**  \nFixup stream resume crash.\n\n- **v0.0.1**  \nInitial Release. Only input is supported.\n\n## The MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Nathan Wittstock\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
