However, it is now quite different and support different platform \r\nbindings, mainly GLFW instead of SDL.\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n============\r\n- node-glfw, which depends on GLEW, GLFW as well as AntTweakBar. See node-glfw for installation instructions.\r\n- freeimage is used to load/save a variety of image formats.\r\n- node-gyp if not already available in your distribution\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n`npm install node-webgl`\r\n\r\n###Installation Notes for Windows 7\r\nBeware of the Node.JS distribution you use. The default Node.JS is 32-bit and this means that modules \r\nwill be compiled by node-gyp with 32-bit settings, which often leads to compilation errors especially\r\non 64-bit systems.\r\n\r\nSo for Windows 7 64-bit, instead of downloading the default Node.JS windows installer, select 'Other release files'.\r\nThis will show you an ftp site for the latest release. Go into x64 folder and download that distribution.\r\n\r\n###Installation Notes for OSX\r\n`brew install anttweakbar freeimage`\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\nexamples/   contains examples from other the web\r\ntest/       contains lessons from www.learningwebgl.com and other tests\r\n\r\nsimply type: node test/lesson02.js\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nLimitations\r\n===========\r\nWebGL is based on OpenGL ES, a restriction of OpenGL found on desktops, for embedded systems.\r\nBecause this module wraps OpenGL, it is possible to do things that may not work on web browsers. \r\nPlease read http://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki_1_15/index.php/WebGL_and_OpenGL_Differences \r\nto learn about the differences.\r\n\r\n- shaders\r\nRemember to add this on top of your fragment shaders:\r\n<pre>\r\n#ifdef GL_ES\r\nprecision highp float;\r\n#endif\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n- loading external scripts\r\nIf your code uses external libraries, you can load them like this. No code change to external scripts ;-)\r\n<pre>\r\nfs=require('fs');\r\neval(fs.readFileSync(__dirname+ '/glMatrix-0.9.5.min.js','utf8'));\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n- frame rate\r\nrequestAnimationFrame(callback [, delay]) works as in the browser. \r\nIf delay is specified, it is the requested delay in milliseconds between animation frames \r\ne.g. 16 will provide 1000 / 16 = 62 fps at best, which is the default value if delay is undefined. \r\nIf delay = 0, then the fastest possible framerate on your machine is used.\r\n\r\nThe timestamp now uses the high-resolution timer in your machine (not new Date()). This provides a much more precise\r\nframerate as well as much better timing for animations.\r\n","starsCount":4,"created":"2012-04-19T00:42:12.654Z","modified":"2016-09-29T11:37:57.034Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"mikeseven","email":"mikeseven@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"mikeseven","email":"mikeseven@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"node-webgl","_nodeVersion":"4.2.2","_npmUser":{"name":"mikeseven","email":"mikeseven@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.7","_rev":"1-ac2802d82dd75fbeea4f9f81e9a457ed","_shasum":"9c15ee951efbd4e912886c4b0abf2915228f201f","author":{"name":"Mikael Bourges-Sevenier","email":"mikeseven@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mikeseven/node-webgl/issues"},"directories":{"src":"src","lib":"lib","doc":"doc","examples":"examples","test":"test"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.5.5"},"dist":{"shasum":"9c15ee951efbd4e912886c4b0abf2915228f201f","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/node-webgl/-/node-webgl-0.5.5.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"mikeseven","email":"mikeseven@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-09-29T11:37:57.034Z","created":"2012-04-19T00:42:12.654Z","0.1.0":"2012-04-19T00:42:14.097Z","0.1.1":"2012-04-19T01:07:57.845Z","0.1.2":"2012-04-19T21:59:33.463Z","0.1.3":"2012-06-30T05:00:40.301Z","0.1.4":"2013-04-25T17:33:26.325Z","0.1.5":"2013-10-31T18:03:42.778Z","0.2.0":"2014-03-29T18:56:21.900Z","0.2.1":"2014-03-31T16:51:13.333Z","0.4.2":"2014-07-02T01:23:42.560Z","0.4.3":"2014-07-02T17:06:49.540Z","0.5.0":"2015-11-20T08:20:58.514Z","0.5.1":"2015-11-26T06:28:07.099Z","0.5.2":"2015-11-26T06:40:05.671Z","0.5.3":"2015-11-27T22:20:47.094Z","0.5.4":"2015-11-28T02:22:04.136Z","0.5.5":"2015-11-28T02:56:13.966Z"},"users":{"duerer":true,"eventhorizon":true,"pandao":true,"andr":true}}}
