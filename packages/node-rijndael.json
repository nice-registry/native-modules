This allows for the encryption and decryption of data generated by Drupal, which uses rijndael-256, despite the AES standard of rijndael-128.\n\nThis module enables interfacing between PHP and Node.js, especially where third-party frameworks like Drupal are involved. Drupal uses rijndael-256 by default, and OPENSSL has no support for any block-side of rijndael apart from 128.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nYou _will_ need a development version of libmcrypt installed on your system to build node-rijndael.\n\n```sh\n# for debian derivatives\n$ [sudo] apt-get install libmcrypt-dev\n# for red hat derivatives\n$ [sudo] yum install libmcrypt-devel\n# for arch linux\n$ [sudo] pacman -S libmcrypt\n```\n\n<small>N.B. if installing `node-rijndael` fails with an error regarding a `\"libmcrypt.h\"` header, this is why.</small>\n\n<small>If you know how to package an external library with a Node Addon, consider submitting a [pull request][pr].</small>\n\n[npm][]\n-------\n\n```sh\n$ npm install node-rijndael\n```\n\n[github][]\n----------\n\n```sh\n$ git clone https://github.com/skeggse/node-rijndael.git\n```\n\nExample\n=======\n\nA functional example demonstrating PHP and Node compatibility is available in the [examples/][examples] directory. A demonstration of the two in a commmand-line example:\n\n```js\n$ node\n> var key = new Buffer('theonetruesecretkeytorulethemall', 'utf-8').toString('base64');\n> var iv = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('base64');\n> iv // we'll use this as the initialization vector for both tests\n'UsKguldtsuLm/KrtnctisA=='\n> var rijndael = require('./examples/rijndael');\n> var plaintext = 'hello, world!';\n> var ciphertext = rijndael.encrypt(plaintext, key, iv);\n> ciphertext\n'50yvJtooiLHUOAbniGgMHmZE18Op99Rhe+Y+G6AjPzM='\n> var plaintext = rijndael.decrypt(ciphertext, key, iv);\n> plaintext\n'hello, world!'\n```\n\nThe only changes you'll generally need to make from the example Node implementation are to add the correct padding, as you may need to use PKCS #5 padding or something similar to be compatible with your specific PHP code.\n\nAPI\n===\n\nAs of `0.1.0`, `node-rijndael` will coerce strings into buffers. As of `0.2.0`, `node-rijndael` pads keys and allows key lengths of 16, 24 and 32 bytes.\n\nnew Rijndael(key, [options])\n-----------------------------\n\nThe constructor creates a Rijndael object bound to a specific key, with methods for encrypting and decrypting.\n\nThe provided key can be either a `Buffer` or a `string`, and if a string is provided, the `encoding` option will be passed to the `Buffer` constructor.\n\n### Options\n\n```js\n{\n  // the key's encoding (defaults to \"binary\", but ignored if the key is a buffer)\n  \"encoding\": \"binary\",\n  // the block cipher mode (defaults to Rijndael.MCRYPT_MODE_ECB)\n  \"mode\": Rijndael.MCRYPT_MODE_ECB,\n  // the initialization vector (defaults to null, and uses encoding if provided string)\n  \"iv\": null\n}\n```\n\n#### Supported Modes\n\n```js\nRijndael.MCRYPT_MODE_ECB\nRijndael.MCRYPT_MODE_CBC\nRijndael.MCRYPT_MODE_CFB\nRijndael.MCRYPT_MODE_OFB\nRijndael.MCRYPT_MODE_NOFB\nRijndael.MCRYPT_MODE_STREAM\n```\n\nRijndael#encrypt(plaintext, [input_encoding, [output_encoding]])\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEncrypt the provided `plaintext` with the bound key, and return the encrypted `ciphertext`. `encrypt` will return a `Buffer` by default.\n\nMay throw an error if unsupported options provided. Most of the checking should happen in the constructor.\n\nRijndael#decrypt(ciphertext, [input_encoding, [output_encoding]])\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDecrypt the provided `ciphertext` with the bound key, and return the decrypted `plaintext`. `decrypt` will return a `Buffer` by default.\n\nMay throw an error if unsupported options provided. Most of the checking should happen in the constructor.\n\nTODO\n====\n\nA bit more functionality now, needs tests.\n\nSee Also\n========\n\nIt looks like @tugrul put together a more complete set of bindings for libmcrypt, called [node-mcrypt][]. This module is specifically for rijndael-256. I will not comment on the quality of the bindings.\n\nUnlicense / Public Domain\n=========================\n\n> This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.\n\n> Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute this software, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.\n\n> In jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws, the author or authors of this software dedicate any and all copyright interest in the software to the public domain.
