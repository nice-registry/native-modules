Must be an integer.\n* size: The size of the segment in bytes. Must be an integer.\n* initialize: (optional) If true, will initialize a new segment, if false, will acquire an already existing one. \n\n## Example\n\n```js\n  \n  const cluster = require('cluster');\n  const { createSharedBuffer } = require('shared-buffer');\n  \n  const SEGMENT_ID = 1024;\n  const SEGMENT_ELEMENTS = 10;\n  const SEGMENT_SIZE = SEGMENT_ELEMENTS * Float64Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT;\n  \n  if (cluster.isMaster) {\n    const sharedBuffer = createSharedBuffer(SEGMENT_ID, SEGMENT_SIZE, true);\n    const sharedArray = new Float64Array(sharedBuffer);\n    for(let i = 0; i < SEGMENT_ELEMENTS; i++)\n      sharedArray[i] = 1/i;\n    cluster.fork();\n  } else {\n    const sharedBuffer = createSharedBuffer(SEGMENT_ID, SEGMENT_SIZE);\n    const sharedArray = new Float64Array(sharedBuffer);\n    console.log(sharedArray);\n    process.exit(0);\n  }\n\n/**\n * Output:\n * Float64Array [\n *   Infinity,\n *   1,\n *   0.5,\n *   0.3333333333333333,\n *   0.25,\n *   0.2,\n *   0.16666666666666666,\n *   0.14285714285714285,\n *   0.125,\n *   0.1111111111111111 ]\n */\n```\n\n## Compatibility\n\nPOSIX only for now, sorry.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2017, Abdullah Ali\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
