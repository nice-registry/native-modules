Based on the CLD2 (Compact Language Detector) library from Google.\n\nHighly optimized for space and speed. Runs about 10x faster than other libraries. Detects over 160 languages. Full test coverage. Runs on Linux, OS X, and Windows.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n$ npm install cld\n```\n\nLinux users, make sure you have g++ >= 4.8. If this is not an option, you should be able to install node-cld 2.4.4 even with an older g++ build.\n\n## Examples\n### Simple\n```js\nrequire('cld').detect('This is a language recognition example', function(err, result) {\n  console.log(result);\n});\n```\n\n### Advanced\n```js\nvar text    = 'Това е пример за разпознаване на Български език';\nvar options = {\n  isHTML       : false,\n  languageHint : 'BULGARIAN',\n  encodingHint : 'ISO_8859_5',\n  tldHint      : 'bg',\n  httpHint     : 'bg'\n};\n\nrequire('cld').detect(text, options, function(err, result) {\n  console.log(result);\n});\n```\n\n\n## Options\n\n#### isHTML\n\nSet to true if the string contains HTML tags\n\n#### languageHint\n\nPass a LANGUAGES key or value as a hint\n\n#### encodingHint\n\nPass an ENCODINGS value as a hint\n\n#### tldHint\n\nPass top level domain as a hint\n\n#### httpHint\n\nPass an HTTP \"Content-Encoding\" value as a hint\n\n## Warning\nOnce the module has been installed, the underlying C source will remain in the ```deps/cld``` folder and continue to occupy considerable space. If you are under severe constraints you can delete this folder and reclam >100M\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright 2011-2015, Blagovest Dachev.\n\n## License\nApache 2\n","starsCount":3,"created":"2011-12-31T15:12:22.369Z","modified":"2017-01-14T04:27:13.399Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"blago","email":"blago@dachev.com"},"owners":[{"name":"dachev","email":"blago@dachev.com"},{"name":"blago","email":"blago@dachev.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"cld","_nodeVersion":"5.10.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/cld-2.4.7.tgz_1475005135961_0.9095216018613428"},"_npmUser":{"name":"blago","email":"blago@dachev.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.8.3","_rev":"6-7687989e88adf3c86c5fc70040e3f866","_shasum":"5035c7dc9f4e3230f8358d0d395da30a46c52374","author":{"name":"Blagovest Dachev","email":"blago@dachev.com","url":"http://www.dachev.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/dachev/cld/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"Lovell Fuller","email":"npm@lovell.info"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"2.4.7"},"dist":{"shasum":"5035c7dc9f4e3230f8358d0d395da30a46c52374","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/cld/-/cld-2.4.7.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"dachev","email":"blago@dachev.com"},{"name":"blago","email":"blago@dachev.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-01-14T04:27:13.399Z","created":"2011-12-31T15:12:22.369Z","0.0.1":"2011-12-31T15:12:24.497Z","0.0.2":"2012-01-14T00:29:08.502Z","0.0.3":"2012-01-14T00:56:02.008Z","0.0.4":"2012-01-14T00:58:25.117Z","0.0.5":"2012-01-14T01:41:18.107Z","0.0.6":"2013-04-28T15:08:10.538Z","2.0.0":"2014-04-26T16:50:23.524Z","2.1.0":"2014-07-07T03:48:29.788Z","2.2.0":"2014-10-20T23:26:24.091Z","2.3.0":"2015-04-18T14:31:11.099Z","2.3.1":"2015-04-18T15:14:25.170Z","2.3.2":"2015-06-16T03:09:57.133Z","2.4.0":"2015-06-16T03:22:08.301Z","2.4.1":"2015-06-20T22:10:15.806Z","2.4.2":"2015-06-20T22:16:40.146Z","2.4.3":"2015-06-22T01:11:07.508Z","2.4.4":"2015-07-14T05:31:52.923Z","2.4.5":"2015-09-12T20:14:26.895Z","2.4.6":"2016-06-05T18:31:35.755Z","2.4.7":"2016-09-27T19:38:56.894Z"},"users":{"josep":true,"debearloper":true,"ierceg":true}}}
