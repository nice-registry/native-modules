designed to run on OpenStreetMap data.\n\nThe following services are available via HTTP API, C++ library interface and NodeJs wrapper:\n- Nearest - Snaps coordinates to the street network and returns the nearest matches\n- Route - Finds the fastest route between coordinates\n- Table - Computes the duration of the fastest route between all pairs of supplied coordinates\n- Match - Snaps noisy GPS traces to the road network in the most plausible way\n- Trip - Solves the Traveling Salesman Problem using a greedy heuristic\n- Tile - Generates Mapbox Vector Tiles with internal routing metadata\n\nTo quickly try OSRM use our [demo server](http://map.project-osrm.org) which comes with both the backend and a frontend on top.\n\nFor a quick introduction about how the road network is represented in OpenStreetMap and how to map specific road network features have a look at [this guide about mapping for navigation](https://www.mapbox.com/mapping/mapping-for-navigation/).\n\nRelated [Project-OSRM](https://github.com/Project-OSRM) repositories:\n- [node-osrm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/osrm) - Production-ready NodeJs bindings for the routing engine\n- [osrm-frontend](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-frontend) - User-facing frontend with map. The demo server runs this on top of the backend\n- [osrm-text-instructions](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-text-instructions) - Text instructions from OSRM route response\n- [osrm-backend-docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/osrm/osrm-backend/) - Ready to use Docker images\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Full documentation\n\n- [Hosted documentation](http://project-osrm.org)\n- [osrm-routed HTTP API documentation](docs/http.md)\n- [libosrm API documentation](docs/libosrm.md)\n\n## Contact\n\n- IRC: `irc.oftc.net`, channel: `#osrm` ([Webchat](https://webchat.oftc.net))\n- Mailinglist: `https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/osrm-talk`\n\n## Quick Start\n\nThe easiest and quickest way to setup your own routing engine is to use Docker images we provide.\n\n### Using Docker\n\nWe base our Docker images ([backend](https://hub.docker.com/r/osrm/osrm-backend/), [frontend](https://hub.docker.com/r/osrm/osrm-frontend/)) on Alpine Linux and make sure they are as lightweight as possible.\n\nDownload OpenStreetMap extracts for example from [Geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/)\n\n    wget http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany/berlin-latest.osm.pbf\n\nPre-process the extract with the car profile and start a routing engine HTTP server on port 5000\n\n    docker run -t -v $(pwd):/data osrm/osrm-backend osrm-extract -p /opt/car.lua /data/berlin-latest.osm.pbf\n    docker run -t -v $(pwd):/data osrm/osrm-backend osrm-contract /data/berlin-latest.osrm\n\n    docker run -t -i -p 5000:5000 -v $(pwd):/data osrm/osrm-backend osrm-routed /data/berlin-latest.osrm\n\nMake requests against the HTTP server\n\n    curl \"http://127.0.0.1:5000/route/v1/driving/13.388860,52.517037;13.385983,52.496891?steps=true\"\n\nOptionally start a user-friendly frontend on port 9966, and open it up in your browser\n\n    docker run -p 9966:9966 osrm/osrm-frontend\n    xdg-open 'http://127.0.0.1:9966'\n\nIn case Docker complains about not being able to connect to the Docker daemon make sure you are in the `docker` group.\n\n    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n\nAfter adding yourself to the `docker` group make sure to log out and back in again with your terminal.\n\nWe support the following images on Docker Cloud:\n\nName | Description\n-----|------\n`latest` | `master` compiled with release flag\n`latest-assertions` | `master` compiled with with release flag, assertions enabled and debug symbols\n`latest-debug` | `master` compiled with debug flag\n`<tag>` | specific tag compiled with release flag\n`<tag>-debug` | specific tag compiled with debug flag\n\n### Building from Source\n\nThe following targets Ubuntu 16.04.\nFor instructions how to build on different distributions, macOS or Windows see our [Wiki](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki).\n\nInstall dependencies\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install build-essential git cmake pkg-config \\\nlibbz2-dev libstxxl-dev libstxxl1v5 libxml2-dev \\\nlibzip-dev libboost-all-dev lua5.2 liblua5.2-dev libtbb-dev\n```\n\nCompile and install OSRM binaries\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p build\ncd build\ncmake ..\ncmake --build .\nsudo cmake --build . --target install\n```\n\nGrab a `.osm.pbf` extract from [Geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/index.html) or [Mapzen's Metro Extracts](https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/)\n\n```bash\nwget http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany/berlin-latest.osm.pbf\n```\n\nPre-process the extract and start the HTTP server\n\n```\nosrm-extract berlin-latest.osm.pbf -p profiles/car.lua\nosrm-contract berlin-latest.osrm\nosrm-routed berlin-latest.osrm\n```\n\nRunning Queries\n\n```\ncurl \"http://127.0.0.1:5000/route/v1/driving/13.388860,52.517037;13.385983,52.496891?steps=true\"\n```\n\n### Request Against the Demo Server\n\nRead the [API usage policy](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki/Api-usage-policy).\nSimple query with instructions and alternatives on Berlin:\n\n```\ncurl \"https://router.project-osrm.org/route/v1/driving/13.388860,52.517037;13.385983,52.496891?steps=true&alternatives=true\"\n```\n\n### Using the Node.js Bindings\n\nThe Node.js bindings provide read-only access to the routing engine.\nWe provide API documentation and examples [here](docs/nodejs/api.md).\n\nYou will need a modern `libstdc++` toolchain (`>= GLIBCXX_3.4.20`) for binary compatibility if you want to use the pre-built binaries.\nFor older Ubuntu systems you can upgrade your standard library for example with:\n\n```\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test\nsudo apt-get update -y\nsudo apt-get install -y libstdc++-5-dev\n```\n\nYou can install the Node.js bindings via `npm install osrm` or from this repository either via\n\n    npm install\n\nwhich will check and use pre-built binaries if they're available for this release and your Node version, or via\n\n    npm install --build-from-source\n\nto always force building the Node.js bindings from source.\n\nFor usage details have a look [these API docs](docs/nodejs/api.md).\n\n\n## References in publications\n\nWhen using the code in a (scientific) publication, please
