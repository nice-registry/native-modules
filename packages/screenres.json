The file should include `headers.h` and implement two functions:\n\n```c++\nResolution fetchRes();\nint changeRes(int h, int v);\n```\n\n`Resolution` is simply a struct with `height` and `width` `int`s.\n\nThe new platform file should also check for platform, e.g.:\n\n```c++\n#ifdef _linux\n //linux screenres implementation\n#endif\n```\n\nFinally, add the new file to `bindings.gyp` in the `sources` array,\nand define any conditional configuration (e.g. like linked libraries).\n\nThat should be it `npm run configure; npm run build`. \n\nThen.. send a PR :)\n\n## Kudos\n\nSponsored by [nearForm](http://nearform.com)\n\n\n\n\n","created":"2015-06-04T17:35:39.831Z","modified":"2015-10-11T11:07:58.543Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"davidmarkclements","email":"huperekchuno@googlemail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"davidmarkclements","email":"huperekchuno@googlemail.com"},{"name":"ionicabizau","email":"bizauionica@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"screenres","_nodeVersion":"0.10.38","_npmUser":{"name":"davidmarkclements","email":"huperekchuno@googlemail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.5.0","_rev":"1-73a6c08a54b40aea1fb3447cd4d95134","_shasum":"ff8e487770687f831b83dd3a3f9cb8120bafd27f","author":{"name":"David Mark Clements"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/davidmarkclements/screenres/issues"},"directories":{"test":"test"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.2","next":"2.0.3-rc1"},"dist":{"shasum":"ff8e487770687f831b83dd3a3f9cb8120bafd27f","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/screenres/-/screenres-1.0.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"davidmarkclements","email":"huperekchuno@googlemail.com"},{"name":"ionicabizau","email":"bizauionica@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-10-11T11:07:58.543Z","created":"2015-06-04T17:35:39.831Z","1.0.0":"2015-06-04T17:35:39.831Z","1.0.1":"2015-06-04T17:37:14.593Z","1.0.2":"2015-06-04T17:41:15.156Z","2.0.0-rc1":"2015-10-11T11:00:59.838Z","2.0.1-rc1":"2015-10-11T11:02:30.311Z","2.0.3-rc1":"2015-10-11T11:07:58.543Z"}}}
