Call it for example every 30 seconds after the first RoomReady (on room initialization)\n\n### C++ instructions\n* Same as unity, using the c++ sources inside cpplib directly or compiling the shared library with the instructions above.\n\n## Release Map\n\n* ### Milestone 1\n\n- [ ] maestro-client\n    - [ ] docs\n    - [x] fake http server\n    - [x] configuration (maestro url / ping interval)\n    - [x] http client\n    - [x] polling to retrieve (host / port)\n    - [ ] deal with connection errors\n    - [x] catch sigterm/sigkill and handle graceful shutdown\n    - [x] unity support\n    - [ ] tests\n    - [x] error handling\n","created":"2017-08-28T17:01:29.988Z","modified":"2017-08-28T18:45:10.590Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"tfgco","email":"provider@tfgco.com"},"owners":[{"name":"tfgco","email":"backend@tfgco.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"maestro-node","_nodeVersion":"6.2.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/maestro-node-0.1.2.tgz_1503945910404_0.2827908818144351"},"_npmUser":{"name":"tfgco","email":"provider@tfgco.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.8.9","_rev":"3-fb06c74a964e52b926413671e7c2c57c","_shasum":"008193cd085346f303302554d2777d6047458552","author":{"name":"TFG Co"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/topfreegames/maestro-client/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"008193cd085346f303302554d2777d6047458552","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/maestro-node/-/maestro-node-0.1.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"tfgco","email":"backend@tfgco.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-08-28T18:45:10.590Z","created":"2017-08-28T17:01:29.988Z","0.1.0":"2017-08-28T17:01:29.988Z","0.1.1":"2017-08-28T17:45:53.703Z","0.1.2":"2017-08-28T18:45:10.590Z"}}}
