Starting with version **0.4.0** it works in **Linux**, **OS X** and **Windows**.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nYou'll need a node version installed in the system. You have several options:\r\n\r\n* Download and install it from the [node website](http://nodejs.org/)\r\n* Install it from your own distro. For the Debian users:\r\n\r\n    `apt-get install nodejs nodejs-legacy`\r\n\r\n* Use [nodesource repository](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions) for different distros.\r\n* Use tools like [nave](https://github.com/isaacs/nave) or [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)\r\n\r\nIn order to install the package you need to have installed in the system the\r\npcsclite libraries. For example, in Debian/Ubuntu:\r\n\r\n    apt-get install libpcsclite1 libpcsclite-dev\r\n\r\nOnce they are installed just run:\r\n\r\n    npm install ts-pcsclite\r\n\r\nTo run any code you will also need to have installed the pcsc daemon:\r\n\r\n    apt-get install pcscd\r\n","created":"2017-07-11T13:41:49.535Z","modified":"2017-07-11T14:25:04.117Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"gilsaaj","email":"jacobgilsaa@hotmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"gilsaaj","email":"jacobgilsaa@hotmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"ts-pcsclite","_nodeVersion":"7.6.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/ts-pcsclite-1.0.4.tgz_1499783102042_0.05467580584809184"},"_npmUser":{"name":"gilsaaj","email":"jacobgilsaa@hotmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.1.2","_rev":"5-7a49d528b974732cf401c294da02a179","_shasum":"d4763b87335e16eace3ea74ba5ab2640d2d2180c","author":{"name":"Jacob Gilsaa","email":"jacobgilsaa@hotmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jgilsaa/ts-pcsclite/issues"},"directories":{"test":"test"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"d4763b87335e16eace3ea74ba5ab2640d2d2180c","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/ts-pcsclite/-/ts-pcsclite-1.0.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"gilsaaj","email":"jacobgilsaa@hotmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-07-11T14:25:04.117Z","created":"2017-07-11T13:41:49.535Z","1.0.0":"2017-07-11T13:41:49.535Z","1.0.1":"2017-07-11T13:45:44.227Z","1.0.2":"2017-07-11T14:00:37.397Z","1.0.3":"2017-07-11T14:19:01.758Z","1.0.4":"2017-07-11T14:25:04.117Z"}}}
