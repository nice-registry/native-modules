This doesn't block node.js i/o.\n\nA `Quit [name]` menu item is added by default. There is no explicit terminate method; you can provide the `onquit` callback that will be dispatched _before_ the application quits.\n\n# building\n\nThis is indeed a super minimal demonstration of building a simple node.js â‡†  Swift bridge using objc runtime. Requires a Xcode build (>=6.3-beta) which is capable of compiling Swift 1.2.\n\n# packaging\n\nNow, I haven't yet tested packaging a Swift framework, but it seems Xcode makes sure linked dependencies are also copied into `build` folder. I have tweaked search paths, so it should be safe to pack up `node_modules` as it is- greatly appreciated if you can open an issue if something goes wrong.\n\n# license\n\nmit","created":"2015-08-03T22:41:23.980Z","modified":"2015-08-03T22:41:23.980Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"tetsuo","email":"ogunduz@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"tetsuo","email":"ogunduz@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"xtray","_nodeVersion":"0.12.5","_npmUser":{"name":"tetsuo","email":"ogunduz@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.12.0","_rev":"1-139ecc76265588952467d87b76cf778d","_shasum":"5df0f90c438dfafba23e323a1c59680851f2d4fa","author":{"name":"Onur Gunduz","email":"ogunduz@gmail.com","url":"http://onurgunduz.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/tetsuo/xtray/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"5df0f90c438dfafba23e323a1c59680851f2d4fa","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/xtray/-/xtray-0.1.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"tetsuo","email":"ogunduz@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"Readme.md","time":{"modified":"2015-08-03T22:41:23.980Z","created":"2015-08-03T22:41:23.980Z","0.1.0":"2015-08-03T22:41:23.980Z"}}}
