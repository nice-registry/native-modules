You\ncan compile this project as a command-line application if you just need some\nbasic functionality.  You may also compile this as a NodeJS module if you need\nto access the data programmatically.\n\n\n## Extraction\n\nThe decision to only write directly to disk rather than buffer the contents and\nreturn to Node was made early on, for two reasons.\n\n1. The time it takes to find a particular file is rather long (seconds), and\nthere's little to no practical reason to retrieve a file, close the archive,\nand then perform this process over again, when you can just extract all the\nfiles you need during a single opening of the archive and save to disk.\n\n2. Some files tip the scales coming in at over 120+MB, there is no practical\nway to pass this file back to Node via a buffer, nor store it within an array\nin C. Additionally, there is little point to making exceptions for certain\nfiles.\n\n\n## Cross-platform Compatability\n\nThe NodeJS module should work on all platforms.\n\nThe CLI works on MacOS X and Linux.  I have neither the time nor the resources\nto build, compile or test on Windows.  Sorry.  Feel free to submit a pull-\nrequest.  A day before I started this project I had no idea how to go about\nbuilding C++ applications into node.  I have faith that you can too.\n\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe following libraries are necessary to build **storm-extract**:\n\n* CascLib (http://www.zezula.net/en/casc/main.html), MIT license\n* SimpleOpt 3.4 (http://code.jellycan.com/simpleopt/), MIT License (included)\n\nTo download the CascLib submodule, do:\n\n    ~$ cd <path/to/the/source/of/storm-extract>\n    storm-extract$ git submodule init\n    storm-extract$ git submodule update\n\n\n## Building\n\n### Command-Line Application\n\nRequires <a href=\"http://www.cmake.org/\">cmake</a> to build:\n\n    $ mkdir build\n    $ cd build\n    $ cmake <path/to/the/source/of/storm-extract>\n    $ make\n\nThe executable will be put in build/bin/\n\n### NodeJS Module\n\nIf you already have `node-gyp`, just install the module:\n\n    $ npm install -g storm-extract\n\nRequires <a href=\"https://www.nodejs.org/>\">NodeJS</a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp\">node-gyp</a> to build:\n\n    $ npm install -g node-gyp\n    $ npm install storm-extract\n\n\n## Usage\n\n### Command-Line Application\n\n```\nstorm-extract v1.0.1\n  Usage: storm-extract [options]\n\nThis program can list and optionally extract files from a Heroes of the Storm CASC storage container.\n\n    -h, --help                Display this help\n\nOptions:\n  Common:\n    -i, --in <PATH>           Directory where '/HeroesData' is\n                                (default: '/Applications/Heroes of the Storm')\n    -v, --verbose             Prints more information\n    -q, --quiet               Prints nothing, nada, zip\n    -s, --search <STRING>     Restrict results to full paths matching STRING\n    -f, --filename <STRING>   Search for filenames matching STRING\n    -t, --filetype <STRING>   Search for filenames having extension STRING\n\n  Search:     storm-extract [options]\n\n  Extract:    storm-extract -x [options]\n    -x, --extract             Extract the files found\n    -o, --out <PATH>          The folder where the files are extracted (extract only)\n                                (default: current working directory)\n\nExamples:\n\n  1) List all files in CASC storage container (this will take a while):\n\n       ./storm-extract -i \"/Applications/Heroes of the Storm/\" -f .\n\n  2) Extract a specific file:\n\n       ./storm-extract -i \"/Applications/Heroes of the Storm/\" -f \"path/to/the/file\" -o out\n\n  3) Extract specific filenames (preserving heirarchy):\n\n       ./storm-extract -i \"/Applications/Heroes of the Storm/\" -f GameData.xml -o out -x\n\n  4) Extract all English sounds (preserving heirarchy):\n\n       ./storm-extract -i \"/Applications/Heroes of the Storm/\" -s enus -o out -t wav -x\n       ./storm-extract -i \"/Applications/Heroes of the Storm/\" -s enus -o out -t ogg -x\n\nCopyright(c) 2016 Justin J. Novack <https://www.github.com/nydus/storm-extract>\n```\n\n### NodeJS Module\n\n    var stormExtract = require('storm-extract');\n    var aFiles = stormExtract.listFiles('/Applications/Heroes of the Storm/');\n    // console.log(aFiles);\n\n    var files = [\n        \"mods/heroesdata.stormmod/base.stormdata/GameData.xml\",\n        \"mods/core.stormmod/base.stormdata/GameData.xml\"\n    ];\n\n    var count = storm.extractFiles('/Applications/Heroes of the Storm/', 'extract', files);\n    console.log(\"Extracted \" + count + \" files.\");\n\n#### Caveats\n\nUnfortunately, this module is entirely synchronous at the moment, it will STALL\nyour event-loop while it processes.  On my machine, to cycle through the entire\nCASC archive takes three (3) seconds; that's three (3) seconds where nothing else\nis happening.  You do not want to include this module into, example, a web\nserver application as it will NOT serve requests for that time.\n\nYou should probably run this module in an application that runs in an entirely\ndifferent thread, perhaps waiting for data from a socket.\n\nIf your application is synchronous (example, some utility application which runs\na process every interval), then there is no need to worry.\n\n#### Bugs\n\nI'm sure, as this is my second C++ to NodeJS module conversion.  Report them to\nthe [github issue tracker](https://github.com/jnovack/storm-extract/issues).\n\n\n## Credits\n\n**storm-extract** stands on the shoulders of giants.\n\nThe library absolutely, unequivocably, could not be possible without\n[ladislav-zezula's CascLib](https://github.com/ladislav-zezula/CascLib)\nlibrary.  Many thanks to [ladislav-zezula](https://github.com/ladislav-zezula).\n\nMost of the program was canibalized from\n[Kanma's CASCExtractor](https://github.com/Kanma/CASCExtractor/) with the\npurpose of customizing it for Heroes of the Storm and integration into\n[NodeJS](https://www.nodejs.org).\n\n\n## License\n\n**storm-extract** is made available under the MIT License.
