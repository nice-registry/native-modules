Only non progressive jpegs supported!\n\n##### Example usage:\n```js\nvar returncode = raspberrypi.displayImage(__dirname + \"/data/raspberry.jpg\", 10);\nconsole.log(\"Done displaying image! Return Code: \" + returncode);\n```\n\n### displayImage(fileName, displayDuration, callback)\nDisplay an image on the screen asyncronously.
