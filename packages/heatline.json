Usual bottom-up logs like the one below are\nreally fancy:\n\n```\n [Bottom up (heavy) profile]:\n  Note: percentage shows a share of a particular caller in the total\n  amount of its parent calls.\n  Callers occupying less than 2.0% are not shown.\n\n   ticks parent  name\n     17   18.9%  node::ContextifyScript::New(v8::FunctionCallbackInfo<v8::Value> const&)\n     17  100.0%    v8::internal::Builtin_HandleApiCallConstruct(int, v8::internal::Object**, v8::internal::Isolate*)\n     17  100.0%      LazyCompile: ~runInThisContext bootstrap_node.js:403:28\n     17  100.0%        LazyCompile: NativeModule.compile bootstrap_node.js:485:44\n     17  100.0%          LazyCompile: ~NativeModule.require bootstrap_node.js:419:34\n      5   29.4%            Function: <anonymous> repl.js:1:11\n      4   23.5%            Function: ~<anonymous> internal/repl.js:1:11\n      2   11.8%            LazyCompile: ~startup bootstrap_node.js:12:19\n      2   11.8%            Function: ~<anonymous> stream.js:1:11\n      1    5.9%            LazyCompile: ~setupGlobalVariables bootstrap_node.js:202:32\n      1    5.9%            Function: ~<anonymous> util.js:1:11\n      1    5.9%            Function: ~<anonymous> tty.js:1:11\n      1    5.9%            Function: ~<anonymous> readline.js:1:11\n```\n\nHowever, in some JavaScript instensive apps it may desirable to find which\nlines of the functions were executed most.\n\n## Heatline\n\nThis can be done with `heatline` pretty easly. `heatline` is built from two\nparts: cli tool and a module to be included in user application.\n\n## User module\n\n```js\nrequire('heatline')();  // will start a server on port number 11337\n```\n\n## CLI tool\n\nOne demo is better than a thousand of words:\n\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/4qlgmk89prjiehzn97xg3ye6b.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/4qlgmk89prjiehzn97xg3ye6b)\n\n## How it works?\n\nThere is a C++ API in V8 for collecting line hits information, this module has a\nC++ addon that consumes this API. See `deps/v8/include/v8-profiler.h` in\n[node.js repo][0].\n\n#### LICENSE\n\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright Fedor Indutny, 2016.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
