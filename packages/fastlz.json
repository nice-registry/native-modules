FastLZ is an\nimplementation of lz77 which may not get the best compression ratio, but is\nrelatively CPU efficient.\n\n## status\n\nThis library is a work in progress. I'm releasing it as 1.0.0 because it is\ngoing into production. But it only supports synchronous compression at the\nmoment. We'll be fleshing out the API as needed (decompression and async) but\nthose will wait on us actually needing those capabilities.\n\nThese bindings have only been tested with Node.js 5.x and 6.x. If you need an\nolder version of node, and that version is still supported by the node core\nteam, patches are welcome to get it working.\n\n## usage\n\n`fastlz.compressSync(sourceBuffer, sourceDataLength) -> compressedBuffer`\n\n`sourceBuffer` is the data you want compressed. `sourceDataLength` is the length\nof the data starting at 0 in the `sourceBuffer`. `compressedBuffer` is a\nminimally sized buffer of the compressed data.\n\n### example\n\n```\nconst fastlz = require('fastlz');\n\nconst dataToCompress = Buffer.from('this string is gunna be smaller!', 'utf8');\nconst compressedData = fastlz.compressSync(dataToCompress, dataToCompress.length);\n```\n\n## license\n\nThese bindings are distributed as ISC, which is compatible with the MIT license\nof FastLZ. You can find both licenses in `LICENSE`.\n","created":"2016-06-30T15:23:59.496Z","modified":"2016-06-30T16:49:32.882Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"wraithan","email":"xwraithanx@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"wraithan","email":"xwraithanx@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"fastlz","_nodeVersion":"5.12.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/fastlz-1.0.1.tgz_1467305369850_0.36053361371159554"},"_npmUser":{"name":"wraithan","email":"xwraithanx@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.8.6","_rev":"1-0e036aaf4ffa4bfa05397190dc0dd1ec","_shasum":"6c266d062ea18d61ca3d44c6e22f48d0a84d267f","author":{"name":"Wraithan","email":"wraithan@sparkypants.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/sparkypants/node-fastlz/issues"},"directories":{"test":"test"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"6c266d062ea18d61ca3d44c6e22f48d0a84d267f","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/fastlz/-/fastlz-1.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"wraithan","email":"xwraithanx@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-06-30T16:49:32.882Z","created":"2016-06-30T15:23:59.496Z","1.0.0":"2016-06-30T15:23:59.496Z","1.0.1":"2016-06-30T16:49:32.882Z"}}}
