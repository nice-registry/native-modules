With this library, you can create [node.js streams](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v6.x/docs/api/stream.html) that can be piped to or from other streams, such as files and network connections. This library supports back-pressure.\r\n\r\nThis is a fork of [naudiodon](/Streampunk/naudiodon)\r\n\r\nNote: This is a server side library. It is not intended as a means to play and record audio via a browser.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nInstall [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) for your platform. This software has been developed against the long term stable (LTS) release. For ease of installation with other node packages, this package includes a copy of the dependent PortAudio library and so has no prerequisites.\r\n\r\nintrasonics-portaudio is designed to be `require` to use from your own application to provide async processing. For example:\r\n\r\n    npm install --save intrasonics-portaudio\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis software is released under the Apache 2.0 license.
