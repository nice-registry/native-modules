It does not correctly reflect the current CPU usage. (this is also a problem with linux `ps` utility)\n\nBut If you call `usage.lookup()` continuously for a given pid, you can turn on **keepHistory** flag and you'll get the CPU usage since last time you track the usage. This reflects the current CPU usage.\n\nsee following example to enable keepHistory flag\n\n~~~js\nvar pid = process.pid;\nvar options = { keepHistory: true }\nusage.lookup(pid, options, function(err, result) {\n\n});\n~~~\n\nyou can clear history cache too\n~~~js\nusage.clearHistory(pid); //clear history for the given pid\nusage.clearHistory(); //clean history for all pids\n~~~\n","created":"2014-08-11T10:37:04.155Z","modified":"2014-08-11T10:37:04.155Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"mirrr","email":"alex.mirrr@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"mirrr","email":"alex.mirrr@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"usage-nan","_npmUser":{"name":"mirrr","email":"alex.mirrr@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.14","_rev":"1-a01613b7e55737c965e47fe4931d8d51","_shasum":"f2b216f043391496362f577afdbf5752d59e8594","author":{"name":"Arunoda Susiripala","email":"arunoda.susiripala@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/arunoda/node-usage/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.4.10"},"dist":{"shasum":"f2b216f043391496362f577afdbf5752d59e8594","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/usage-nan/-/usage-nan-0.4.10.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"mirrr","email":"alex.mirrr@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2014-08-11T10:37:04.155Z","created":"2014-08-11T10:37:04.155Z","0.4.10":"2014-08-11T10:37:04.155Z"}}}
