It lives in it's own module so it can be an optional\ndependency for the [bson](http://npm.im/bson) module.\n\n## Testing\n\n```\nnpm test\n```\n\n## Prebuilt Binaries\n\nHave you ever seen this message in your console?\n\n```\njs-bson: Failed to load c++ bson extension, using pure JS version\n```\n\nWe are experimenting with [node-pre-gyp](http://npm.im/node-pre-gyp) to publish\nand install prebuilt binaries.  This means you don't need the full toolchain installed\nand configured correctly to use this module and you'll never have to see this\nmessage again.  Currently, prebuilt binaries will only be used for Windows,\nas it is the most problematic platform for this issue.  This will also allow us\nmore time to evaluate the costs and benefits of prebuilt support on OSX and Linux.\n\nIf you are interested in prebuilt binary support on OSX or Linux, please\n[join the discussion on this issue](https://github.com/christkv/bson-ext/issues/6)!\n\n## License\n\nApache 2\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2016-10-22T09:18:45.587Z","modified":"2016-10-22T09:23:57.731Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"cashsun","email":"mr.cashsun@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"cashsun","email":"mr.cashsun@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"bson-ext2","_nodeVersion":"4.4.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/bson-ext2-0.1.16.tgz_1477128197852_0.8670251704752445"},"_npmUser":{"name":"cashsun","email":"mr.cashsun@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.20","_rev":"3-89f83139a5463653255fe6f0c75125db","_shasum":"bfbd78e5a651a115855320c8ba6518e41fb0a975","author":{"name":"Christian Amor Kvalheim","email":"christkv@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/christkv/bson-ext/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"Cash Sun","email":"mr.cashsun@gmail.com"}],"directories":{"lib":"./lib/bson"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.16"},"dist":{"shasum":"bfbd78e5a651a115855320c8ba6518e41fb0a975","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/bson-ext2/-/bson-ext2-0.1.16.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"cashsun","email":"mr.cashsun@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-10-22T09:23:57.731Z","created":"2016-10-22T09:18:45.587Z","0.1.15":"2016-10-22T09:18:45.587Z","0.1.16":"2016-10-22T09:23:19.145Z"},"users":{"cashsun":true}}}
