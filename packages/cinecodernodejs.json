All the node wrapping and testing functions were made by the nice folks at StreamPunk Media, and passed to Cinegy for us to add our interfaces to get the Cinecoder binary to work with the addon. Complain to Cinegy first if we break something going forward before bothering the StreamPunk team!\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nInstall [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) for your platform. This software has been developed against the long term stable (LTS) 6.11.x release.\r\n\r\nThis module has native C++ files that are compiled with node-gyp. To use the module, you many need to install a C++ compiler and python v2.x on your system. On Windows, compilation has been tested using the community edition of Microsoft Visual Studio 2015. On Windows, node may need to be configured with:\r\n\r\n    npm config set msvs_version 2015 --global\r\n\r\nCinecoderNodeJs is designed to be `require`d to use from your own application to provide async processing.\r\n\r\n    npm install --save cinecodernodejs\r\n\r\nNode.js addons use [libuv](http://libuv.org/) which by default supports up to 4 async threads in a threadpool for activities such as file I/O. These same threads are used by cinecoder and if you wish to use a number of the functions in one Node.js process then you will need to set the environment variable UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE to a suitable number before the first use of the libuv threadpool.\r\n\r\n## Using cinecodernodejs\r\n\r\nTo use cinecoder in your own application, `require` the module then create and use workers as required.  The processing functions follow a standard pattern as shown in the example code below.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar cinecoder = require('cinecodernodejs');\r\nvar fn = new cinecoder.fn(params);\r\n\r\nfn.on('exit', function() {\r\n  fn.finish();\r\n});\r\nfn.on('error', function(err) {\r\n// handle error \r\n});\r\n\r\n// start the processing thread\r\nfn.start();\r\n\r\n// async request for processing to be done\r\nfn.doFn(params, function(err, result) {\r\n});\r\n\r\n// async request for the processing thread to quit\r\nfn.quit(function() {\r\n});\r\n```\r\n## Status, support and further development\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis software is released under the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n\r\nCopyright 2016 Streampunk Media Ltd.\r\nCopyright 2017 Cinegy GmbH.\r\n","created":"2017-03-31T15:48:08.434Z","modified":"2017-08-14T10:08:15.834Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"cinegy","email":"lewis@cinegy.com"},"owners":[{"name":"cinegy","email":"lewis@cinegy.com"},{"name":"scriptorian","email":"scriptorian@streampunk.media"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"cinecodernodejs","_nodeVersion":"6.11.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/cinecodernodejs-0.1.2.tgz_1502705293509_0.9930842989124358"},"_npmUser":{"name":"cinegy","email":"lewis@cinegy.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.10","_rev":"7-5a0244af57e59c9bc6a4abd9778710cb","_shasum":"e7d86cadecd7302f396cea3c0074b209b6a97420","author":{"name":"Cinegy GmbH"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"e7d86cadecd7302f396cea3c0074b209b6a97420","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/cinecodernodejs/-/cinecodernodejs-0.1.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"cinegy","email":"lewis@cinegy.com"},{"name":"scriptorian","email":"scriptorian@streampunk.media"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-08-14T10:08:15.834Z","created":"2017-03-31T15:48:08.434Z","0.0.1":"2017-03-31T15:48:08.434Z","0.0.2":"2017-04-04T16:12:10.250Z","0.1.0":"2017-04-07T11:06:25.885Z","0.1.1":"2017-07-27T12:57:25.334Z","0.1.2":"2017-08-14T10:08:15.834Z"}}}
