It does not attempt at being a complete binding, and will hopefully one day be replaced by (or implemented with) node-gir.\n\n## How?\n\n```javascript\nconst gstreamer = require('gstreamer-superficial');\nconst pipeline = new gstreamer.Pipeline(`videotestsrc ! textoverlay name=text\n\t! autovideosink`);\n\t\npipeline.play();\n```\n\nThen, you can find an element within the pipeline, and set its properties:\n\n```javascript\nconst target = pipeline.findChild('text');\n\ntarget.text = 'Hello';\nObject.assign(target.text, {\n\ttext: 'Hello', \n\t'font-desc': 'Helvetica 32',\n})\n```\n\n(see also _examples/basic-pipeline.js_)\n\nPipeline also knows `.stop()`, `.pause()` and `.pollBus()`,\nthe elements returned by `.findChild()` getting and setting all properties the real [`GObject`](https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/gobject-The-Base-Object-Type.html)s do, appsinks also support `.pull()` (see below). \n\n\n### Polling the GStreamer Pipeline Bus\n\nYou can asynchronously handle bus messages using Pipeline.pollBus(callback):\n\n```javascript\npipeline.pollBus(msg => {\n\tconsole.log(msg);\n});\n```\n\n(see also _examples/bus.js_)\n\n\n### Handling binary data\n\nYou can feast off GStreamer's appsink to handle binary data.\n.pull starts a background work queue and calls your callback whenever a buffer is (or caps are) available:\n\n```javascript\nconst appsink = pipeline.findChild('sink');\n\nfunction onData(buf, caps) {\n\tif (caps) {\n\t\tconsole.log('CAPS', caps);\n\t}\n\tif (buf) {\n\t\tconsole.log('BUFFER size', buf.length);\n\t\tappsink.pull(onData);\n\t}\n\n\t// !buf probably means EOS\n}\n\nappsink.pull(onData);\n```\n\n(see _examples/appsink.js_)\n\n\n### A simple Ogg/Theora streaming server\n\nshould be working as implemented in _examples/streaming/_  \nrun server.js (requires express) and point your browser to http://localhost:8001. (Tested only with Chromium).\nThis handles retaining the streamheader to feed first to every newly connected client.\n\n\n## Who?\n\ngstreamer-superficial was originally written by Daniel Turing, and has \nreceived contributions from various individuals as seen on github and\nin package.json.\n","created":"2017-01-17T15:49:11.004Z","modified":"2017-06-21T08:36:16.841Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"dturing","email":"mail@danielturing.com"},"owners":[{"name":"dturing","email":"mail@danielturing.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"gstreamer-superficial","_nodeVersion":"6.8.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/gstreamer-superficial-0.0.4.tgz_1498034175854_0.8080196541268378"},"_npmUser":{"name":"dturing","email":"mail@danielturing.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.8","_rev":"2-f955ee0fc1a6e178ac64460c1ec3e173","_shasum":"b1f9e3f9e341f6e61b44c06776143cf4905b377a","author":{"name":"Daniel Turing","email":"mail@danielturing.com","url":"http://danturing.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/dturing/node-gstreamer-superficial/issues"},"contributors":[{"name":"Jon Nettleton","url":"https://github.com/linux4kix"},{"name":"Anton K.","url":"https://github.com/dasantonym"},{"name":"Scott Przybylski","url":"https://github.com/skaughtx0r"},{"name":"Simon Wanner","email":"skyrising@pvpctutorials.de","url":"https://pvpctutorials.de"},{"name":"Greg Futia","url":"linux@gregfutia.com"},{"name":"Andy McLeod","url":"https://github.com/macdudeuk"}],"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"b1f9e3f9e341f6e61b44c06776143cf4905b377a","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/gstreamer-superficial/-/gstreamer-superficial-0.0.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"dturing","email":"mail@danielturing.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-06-21T08:36:16.841Z","created":"2017-01-17T15:49:11.004Z","0.0.3":"2017-01-17T15:49:11.004Z","0.0.4":"2017-06-21T08:36:16.841Z"}}}
