The queue store can be accessed by multi-process.\n  (Now, it is node.js only, but its core is implemented by C++, it'll be easy to make it work for other languages.)\n  \n## Usage\n- Producer\n```js\nvar LmdbQueue = require('../'),\n    Producer = LmdbQueue.Producer;\n\nvar producer = new Producer({ path: __dirname + '/test-data', topic: 'test', dataType: LmdbQueue.STRING_TYPE, chunkSize: 64 * 1024 * 1024, chunksToKeep: 8 });\n\n/*\noptions:\n  path: The path where to put queue files, remember to create it before open it.\n  topic: Topic name.\n  dataType:\n    LmdbQueue.STRING_TYPE: message is treated as string.\n    LmdbQueue.BUFFER_TYPE: message is treated as buffer.\n  chunkSize: The size of data chunk(in bytes).\n  chunksToKeep: How many chunks to keep.\n*/\n\nproducer.push(['abcdeaef', 'deffdaf']);\n```\n\n- Consumer\n```js\nvar LmdbQueue = require('../'),\n    Consumer = LmdbQueue.Consumer;\n\nvar consumer = new Consumer({ path: __dirname + '/test-data', topic: 'test', name: 'test', dataType: LmdbQueue.STRING_TYPE, chunkSize: 64 * 1024 * 1024, batchSize: 1024 * 16 });\n/*\noptions:\n  path: The path where to put queue files, remember to create it before open it.\n  topic: Topic name.\n  dataType:\n    LmdbQueue.STRING_TYPE: message is treated as string.\n    LmdbQueue.BUFFER_TYPE: message is treated as buffer.\n  chunkSize: The size of data chunk(in bytes).\n  batchSize: The read batch size.\n*/\n\nvar msg;\nwhile (msg = consumer.pop()) {\n    // ...do sth with msg...\n}\n```\n","created":"2015-05-20T06:09:48.606Z","modified":"2017-07-13T03:40:01.478Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"talrasha007","email":"talrasha007@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"talrasha007","email":"talrasha007@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"lmdb-queue","_nodeVersion":"8.1.2","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/lmdb-queue-0.2.0.tgz_1499917201323_0.22509284829720855"},"_npmUser":{"name":"talrasha007","email":"talrasha007@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"5.0.3","_rev":"2-920d4131da7dfe0f39a64ca7efb38781","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/talrasha007/lmdb-queue/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.2.0"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-TwVEUW1WfTMuMwfun3TG4ox1SJMi5KI6rCx4OQAnYQYvNZWgy8CR3MQz6Vk0ibR9JP/t6afgF5HORZTQcRDVSw==","shasum":"9d7ee203460b24916075fa2b33f0fee8288d317b","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/lmdb-queue/-/lmdb-queue-0.2.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"talrasha007","email":"talrasha007@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-07-13T03:40:01.478Z","created":"2015-05-20T06:09:48.606Z","0.0.1":"2015-05-20T06:09:48.606Z","0.0.2":"2015-05-20T10:13:21.291Z","0.0.2-1":"2015-05-20T10:36:56.435Z","0.0.3":"2015-05-26T02:47:56.546Z","0.1.0":"2015-05-29T03:57:37.988Z","0.1.1":"2015-06-15T10:27:08.436Z","0.1.2":"2015-08-26T02:27:36.328Z","0.2.0":"2017-07-13T03:40:01.478Z"}}}
