It is relatively obscure but still shows up occasionally. This package currently only handles buffers with a 4-byte uncompressed-length header. The more complex headers which came later (LHA/LHarc) are not currently supported.\n\nCurrently broken for multiple decompress calls. Will fix shortly or send a PR.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n$ npm install lzh\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nlzh = require('lzh')\nx = lzh.compress(new Buffer(\"hello world\"))\nlzh.decompress(x).toString()\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n```bash\n$ npm test\n```\n\n## License\n\n  [MIT](LICENSE)\n","created":"2015-01-12T16:41:13.275Z","modified":"2015-01-15T18:05:00.777Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"msmiley","email":"mikesmiley@me.com"},"owners":[{"name":"msmiley","email":"mikesmiley@me.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"lzh","_nodeVersion":"0.10.35","_npmUser":{"name":"msmiley","email":"mikesmiley@me.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.1.17","_rev":"1-4201a5680f0d233fb79c608f82ee84d0","_shasum":"1a0185c31abd5719d945e16408669a34750dae4c","author":{"name":"Mike Smiley","email":"mikesmiley@me.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/msmiley/lzh/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"1a0185c31abd5719d945e16408669a34750dae4c","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/lzh/-/lzh-0.0.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"msmiley","email":"mikesmiley@me.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-01-15T18:05:00.777Z","created":"2015-01-12T16:41:13.275Z","0.0.1":"2015-01-12T16:41:13.275Z","0.0.2":"2015-01-12T16:42:42.662Z","0.0.3":"2015-01-14T21:21:09.027Z","0.0.4":"2015-01-15T18:05:00.777Z"}}}
