Ryan had plans to write this binding as part of [GSoC].\nIt is now used by many projects and has more than 10 contributors,\nwho are listed in the [AUTHORS](https://github.com/Sannis/node-mysql-libmysqlclient/blob/master/AUTHORS) file.\nI also maintain the [Node.js MySQL bindings benchmark] which shows how mysql-libmysqlclient performs.\n\nNode-mysql-libmysqlclient's source code is available in the [Github repo] and you can report issues at the project tracker.\nVisit the [module site] for API docs and examples. You can also read some extra information in [wiki].\n\n[GSoC]: http://code.google.com/soc/\n[Node.js MySQL bindings benchmark]: https://github.com/Sannis/node-mysql-benchmarks\n[GitHub repo]: https://github.com/Sannis/node-mysql-libmysqlclient\n[module site]: http://sannis.github.com/node-mysql-libmysqlclient\n[wiki]: https://github.com/Sannis/node-mysql-libmysqlclient/wiki\n\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nTo build this module you must install the libmysqlclient library and the development files for it.  \n`mysql_config` is used to determine the paths to the library and header files.  \nTo install these dependencies, execute the commands below for the OS you're running.\n\nFor CentOS:\n\n    #> yum install mysql-devel\n\nFor openSUSE:\n\n    #> zypper install libmysqlclient-devel\n\nFor Debian-based systems/Ubuntu:\n\n    #> apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev\n\nAlternatively, you can use `aptitude` for Debian-based systems.\n\nPlease refer to your system's documentation for more information and feel free to send me a patch for this readme.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou can install this module via NPM:\n\n    $> npm install mysql-libmysqlclient\n\nYou can also build latest source code from repository.\nPlease refer to the developers documentation for more information.\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nThis module is written in collaboration with many peoples listed on [GitHub contributors page].\nList of [authors ordered by first contribution] also available.\n\nIf you are interested in wide MySQL usage in Node.JS applications,\nleave your comments to the code.\nTo contribute any patches, simply fork this repository using GitHub\nand send a pull request to [me](https://github.com/Sannis).
