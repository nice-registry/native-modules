You can check the sizes to find the one which looks correct.\nNow run `diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk#` (replace # with your disk number e.g. `diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk4`) to unmount the drive.\n\nType: `sudo dd bs=1m if=`\nNow without hitting enter find the arc linux download image from your downloads folder and drag it into your terminal. It should input the full file name and leave a space at the end.\n\nEg: `sudo dd bs=1m if=/Users/ollym/Downloads/2016-05-27-raspbian-jessie-lite.img `\n\nYou will end up with a long command in your terminal window, something like:\n`sudo dd bs=1m if=/Users/ollym/Downloads/2016-05-27-raspbian-jessie-lite.img of=/dev/rdisk4 && echo ok`\n\nNow hit enter, type in your password, and hit enter again. Note when typing in your password it will not respond with any masked characters, just keep typing as normal.\nNow wait a LONG TIME. You can press Ctrl + t to see the progress. When the operation completes you'll see a final \"ok\" written in the terminal.\n\nWhen that's finished, eject the SD card by running `diskutil eject disk#` (replacing # like before).\n\nNow make sure you have the raspberry pi plugged into your router, then plug the SD in and turn it on.\n\nWait about 30 seconds for the device to boot up. Now log into the admin panel of your router and find a list of connected devices. You need to establish the IP Address for the pi, it will have a hostname of \"raspberrypi\".\n\nNow with the IP Address ( e.g. 192.168.0.15) go back to the terminal and run: `ssh pi@192.168.0.15`\n\nIf you're asked to confirm the computer's identity, just type \"yes\" and hit enter. You will be then prompted for a password. The password will be `raspberry`.\n\nNow you will provided with a new prompt like so: `[pi@raspberrypi ~]# `\n\nJust run the following command: `\\curl -ksSL https://gist.github.com/ollym/aa9832e2680f48d6c3b2acb936e683e1/raw/install.sh | sh` and watch it go.\n\nAt the end of the process you'll be presented with a screen that looks like this:\n\n(http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Fu4KL0Kvy7A/Um0Zq2n3rDI/AAAAAAAAEwM/_RoXNopIF6k/s640/raspi-config-configuration-rasbian.png)[]\n\nYou first need to `Expand Filesystem`, and when it asks if you want to restart say NO. Now back on the main menu, go to `Advanced Options -> SPI -> Enable`, then go back, go to `Finish` and let the system reboot.\n\nThen everything should be complete.","created":"2016-05-25T16:11:17.935Z","modified":"2017-07-23T03:31:15.701Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"ollym","email":"ollym@me.com"},"owners":[{"email":"bartosz.blimke+ticketinghub@gmail.com","name":"th-admin"},{"email":"bartosz.blimke@gmail.com","name":"bartoszblimke"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"th-gate","_nodeVersion":"4.2.4","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/th-gate-0.1.4.tgz_1465813072379_0.20624101720750332"},"_npmUser":{"name":"ollym","email":"ollym@me.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.12","_rev":"15-3384fde9244a89edba91c1dd8440be10","_shasum":"64951c3a34d6fc45b07898f6fbac76b04aa97113","author":{"name":"Oliver Morgan","email":"olly@ticketinghub.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ticketinghub/gate-manager/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.4","beta":"0.1.10-beta"},"dist":{"shasum":"64951c3a34d6fc45b07898f6fbac76b04aa97113","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/th-gate/-/th-gate-0.1.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"email":"bartosz.blimke+ticketinghub@gmail.com","name":"th-admin"},{"email":"bartosz.blimke@gmail.com","name":"bartoszblimke"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-07-23T03:31:15.701Z","created":"2016-05-25T16:11:17.935Z","0.0.1":"2016-05-25T16:11:17.935Z","0.0.2":"2016-05-25T16:15:53.295Z","0.0.3":"2016-05-25T16:17:01.125Z","0.0.4":"2016-05-26T17:51:59.165Z","0.0.5":"2016-05-26T17:57:59.827Z","0.1.1":"2016-06-08T08:28:29.459Z","0.1.2":"2016-06-08T08:47:49.418Z","0.1.3":"2016-06-08T09:34:08.632Z","0.1.4":"2016-06-13T10:17:55.181Z","0.1.5-beta":"2017-01-10T14:59:59.962Z","0.1.6-beta":"2017-01-11T15:23:27.235Z","0.1.7-beta":"2017-01-11T15:34:45.259Z","0.1.8-beta":"2017-01-11T15:37:25.817Z","0.1.9-beta":"2017-01-11T15:54:52.405Z","0.1.10-beta":"2017-01-12T02:24:19.840Z"}}}
