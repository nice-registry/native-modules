S2 has no documentation besides\nsource comments and [this presentation](https://cloudup.com/cVR0jOEufLR).\nNotably it's used for [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/)'s [2dsphere index](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/2dsphere/),\nas well as in [viewfinderco](https://github.com/viewfinderco/viewfinder)'s\n[DynamoDB](http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)-powered database. [s2map.com](http://s2map.com/)\nalso demonstrates one of the killer features of the library, 'coverings', which\nare intelligently computed groups of cells that can be used to index geometries.\n\n## Example\n\n```js\nvar s2 = require('s2');\n\nvar ll = new s2.S2LatLng(0, 0);\nll.isValid(); // true\nvar normalized = ll.normalized(); // true\nvar pt = ll.toPoint();\n```\n\n## Build\n\n    npm install\n    npm build . --build-from-source\n    npm test\n\n## Geojson\n\nnode-s2 is a low level s2 wrapper. If you are simply looking to get geojson into s2, you should check out [geojson-cover](https://github.com/mapbox/geojson-cover).\n\n## [Documentation: API.md](API.md)\n\n## Notes\n\nSome of the S2 API is not wrapped because it isn't meant to be exposed in this way,\nand is blocked from wrapping by [DISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml#Copy_Constructors).\n\n* S2CellUnion\n* S2Loop\n* S2Polyline\n* S2Polygon\n* S2RegionCoverer\n* S2RegionIntersection\n\n## See Also\n\n* [s2-geometry-javascript](https://github.com/jonatkins/s2-geometry-javascript) - an incomplete port of S2 to JavaScript.\n* [gos2](https://code.google.com/p/gos2/) - very incomplete port to Go\n* [viewfinder built a python wrapper](https://github.com/viewfinderco/third_party/blob/master/python-package/s2-0.2.tar.gz)\n* [s2-geometry-php](https://github.com/eelf/s2-geometry-library-php) - another very incomplete port to PHP\n* [interview with david blackman](http://www.fastcolabs.com/3007394/open-company/how-foursquare-building-humane-map-framework-rival-googles)\n","created":"2016-11-07T21:50:48.321Z","modified":"2016-11-07T21:50:48.321Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"gerhardberger","email":"93.morph@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"gerhardberger","email":"93.morph@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"gerhardberger-s2","_nodeVersion":"6.9.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/gerhardberger-s2-0.5.2.tgz_1478555445486_0.3962595392949879"},"_npmUser":{"name":"gerhardberger","email":"93.morph@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.8","_rev":"1-99ab334e05e2f5e11cf6be24aab3338d","_shasum":"6c7b1d08016c5a0fff6057c1c91d4e9e9713fcaa","author":{"name":"Tom MacWright","email":"tom@macwright.org","url":"http://macwright.org/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mapbox/node-s2/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.5.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"6c7b1d08016c5a0fff6057c1c91d4e9e9713fcaa","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/gerhardberger-s2/-/gerhardberger-s2-0.5.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"gerhardberger","email":"93.morph@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-11-07T21:50:48.321Z","created":"2016-11-07T21:50:48.321Z","0.5.2":"2016-11-07T21:50:48.321Z"}}}
