Some additional\nchanges were made in order to have it compile and run under windows operating system.\n\nThanks to the following you can compile and install `node-mpg123n` using npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install mpg123n\n```\n\n[node-gyp environment setup](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp#installation)\n\nExample\n------------\nHere's an example of how `node-mpg123n` can be used to start and stop a single song. The path\nto an mp3 file is passed from command-line.\n\n``` javascript\nvar mpg123n = require('mpg123n');\n\nvar player = new mpg123n.Player();\n\nplayer.on('play', function() {\n\tconsole.log(\"playing!\");\n});\nplayer.on('stop', function() {\n\tconsole.log(\"stopped!\");\n});\nplayer.on('pause', function() {\n\tconsole.log('paused!');\n});\nplayer.on('error', function() {\n\tconsole.log('Houston we have a problem!');\n});\nplayer.play(process.argv[2]);\n```\n\nAPI\n------------\n### Methods\n * Player.play - path to a file\n * Player.stop \n * Player.pause \n * Player.jump - offset in seconds, eg. 10s\n * Player.volume - volume in percent eg. 10%\n\n### Events\n * play\n * stop\n * pause\n * error\n\nProjects using mpg123n\n------------\n### [Maracuyá Jukebox](http://maracuya-jukebox.com)\n * contains precompiled version of mpg123n\n * embeds nodejs\n * utilizes a simple yet powerful interface\n\n","created":"2013-05-01T20:07:44.550Z","modified":"2016-07-18T19:18:06.472Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"bendi","email":"marek@bedkowski.pl"},"owners":[{"name":"bendi","email":"marek@bedkowski.pl"},{"name":"thorikawa","email":"horikawa.takahiro@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"mpg123n","_nodeVersion":"6.0.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/mpg123n-0.0.23.tgz_1468869449966_0.9239173324313015"},"_npmUser":{"name":"bendi","email":"marek@bedkowski.pl"},"_npmVersion":"3.8.6","_rev":"1-c93d1ce349d7fb801084c6369ba1800e","_shasum":"da88b4836fff82c26dafa998b38136af18b45db3","author":{"name":"Marek Będkowski","email":"marek@bedkowski.pl","url":"http://thejsteam.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/bendi/node-mpg123n/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.23"},"dist":{"shasum":"da88b4836fff82c26dafa998b38136af18b45db3","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/mpg123n/-/mpg123n-0.0.23.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"bendi","email":"marek@bedkowski.pl"},{"name":"thorikawa","email":"horikawa.takahiro@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-07-18T19:18:06.472Z","created":"2013-05-01T20:07:44.550Z","0.0.1":"2013-05-01T20:07:55.110Z","0.0.2":"2013-05-02T19:09:49.678Z","0.0.3":"2013-05-12T19:27:40.658Z","0.0.4":"2013-05-13T19:54:33.287Z","0.0.5":"2013-05-13T20:09:31.827Z","0.0.6":"2013-05-20T20:24:54.491Z","0.0.7":"2013-05-27T19:11:02.302Z","0.0.8":"2013-06-02T13:30:08.590Z","0.0.9":"2013-08-21T19:38:47.611Z","0.0.10":"2013-08-25T10:34:00.850Z","0.0.11":"2013-08-25T10:41:06.371Z","0.0.12":"2014-01-10T20:41:18.512Z","0.0.13":"2014-01-10T20:49:05.786Z","0.0.14":"2014-01-19T16:40:20.224Z","0.0.15":"2014-01-26T17:01:00.957Z","0.0.16":"2014-01-26T21:10:50.204Z","0.0.17":"2014-02-18T21:44:35.220Z","0.0.18":"2014-02-23T21:19:11.318Z","0.0.19":"2014-02-23T22:04:37.020Z","0.0.20":"2014-04-22T18:39:33.161Z","0.0.21":"2014-05-24T08:10:08.820Z","0.0.23":"2016-07-18T19:17:32.940Z"}}}
