Install [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images)\n2. on PI 2 or 3 install [NodeJS 8](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions)  or on PI 1 [uninstall NodeJS and install new NodeJS](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/48303/install-nodejs-for-all-raspberry-pi) (replace node-v6.2.1-linux-armv6l.tar.gz with some 8 version from https://nodejs.org/dist)\n3. Install [Pi Blaster](https://github.com/sarfata/pi-blaster) from [sources](https://github.com/sarfata/pi-blaster#build-and-install-directly-from-source) that you clone to some directory:\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/sarfata/pi-blaster\n```\n### Install and run main package\n```shell\nsudo npm install -g robot-control\nrobot-control\n```\nOpen the application on port 3100 in state of art browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) (use Chrome on Android device)\n\n# Testing on PC and Mac\n1. Install NodeJS for your OS from [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)\n2. Install main package from command line\n```shell\nnpm install -g robot-control\n```\nor\n```shell\nsudo npm install -g robot-control\n```\n3. Run main package\n```shell\nrobot-control\n```\n4. Open the application on port 3100 in state of art browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) (use Chrome on Android device)\n\n# Future work\n## Documentation for UI and UI programming\nWithout documentation nobody is able to create his own UI :(\n\n## Support for customization of UI\nCustom backgrounds, more controls like buttons, sliders etc.\n## Support for I2C\n\nIn near future (few weeks) this project should start to support I2C bus and [Adafruit PWM Board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/815) that you can buy for few dollars on [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20170627113451&SearchText=16-Channel+12-bit+PWM%2FServo+Driver+I2C) o eBay.\n## Support for Arduino\n\n## Docker images","versions":[{"number":"0.0.1","date":"2017-06-26T16:53:52.224Z"},{"number":"0.0.2","date":"2017-06-26T16:59:29.045Z"},{"number":"0.0.2-alpha.1","date":"2017-06-26T17:06:25.594Z"},{"number":"0.0.2-alpha.2","date":"2017-06-26T18:24:34.292Z"},{"number":"0.0.2-alpha.3","date":"2017-06-26T20:00:26.026Z"},{"number":"0.0.2-alpha.4","date":"2017-06-27T18:06:47.179Z"},{"number":"0.0.2-alpha.5","date":"2017-06-27T19:42:23.589Z"},{"number":"0.0.2-alpha.6","date":"2017-06-27T20:16:56.740Z"},{"number":"0.0.2-alpha.7","date":"2017-07-01T18:28:50.047Z"},{"number":"0.0.2-alpha.8","date":"2017-07-01T18:31:04.204Z"},{"number":"0.0.2-alpha.9","date":"2017-07-09T20:09:54.706Z"}],"created":"2017-06-26T16:53:52.224Z","modified":"2017-07-09T20:09:54.706Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"saboteurspk","email":"michal.merta.spk@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"saboteurspk","email":"michal.merta.spk@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"robot-control","_nodeVersion":"8.1.3","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/robot-control-0.0.2-alpha.9.tgz_1499630992950_0.5623371638357639"},"_npmUser":{"name":"saboteurspk","email":"michal.merta.spk@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"5.0.3","_rev":"16-abef72590cc107d572ae9798305042d4","author":"","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/SaboteurSpk/robot-control/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.2-alpha.9"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-wxhx0E9Vi942cimR9HSYYDEj+vUXjYZtoyadsIiaLR6JmtmrsgZPtPOmec3E86Q4ybbCz4ac8HqkuekeQ8r6ig==","shasum":"62532a3fc98154e085a88f8d0d44d58596561ee8","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/robot-control/-/robot-control-0.0.2-alpha.9.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"saboteurspk","email":"michal.merta.spk@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"readme.md","time":{"modified":"2017-07-09T20:09:54.706Z","created":"2017-06-26T16:53:52.224Z","0.0.1":"2017-06-26T16:53:52.224Z","0.0.2":"2017-06-26T16:59:29.045Z","0.0.2-alpha.1":"2017-06-26T17:06:25.594Z","0.0.2-alpha.2":"2017-06-26T18:24:34.292Z","0.0.2-alpha.3":"2017-06-26T20:00:26.026Z","0.0.2-alpha.4":"2017-06-27T18:06:47.179Z","0.0.2-alpha.5":"2017-06-27T19:42:23.589Z","0.0.2-alpha.6":"2017-06-27T20:16:56.740Z","0.0.2-alpha.7":"2017-07-01T18:28:50.047Z","0.0.2-alpha.8":"2017-07-01T18:31:04.204Z","0.0.2-alpha.9":"2017-07-09T20:09:54.706Z"}}}
