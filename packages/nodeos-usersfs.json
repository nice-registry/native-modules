It has a *root* user (used to initialize some sub-systems) and a\nlogable *nodeos* user with some basic pre-installed packages like a shell\n([nsh](https://github.com/groundwater/node-bin-nsh)) and some basic tools and\ndemo commands. You can login using password *nodeos*.\n\nTo create you own users filesystem, its structure is just that each folder on\nroot directory will be considered a valid user, and each one must have unique\nUIDs & GIDs diferent from the others, being this ones different of zero, and\nideally set with an umask 0077 (access only to owner).\n\nThe system will craft a per-user root filesystem on top of each one of the users\ndirectories. If there's a (non mandadory) user folder with UID & GID equal to\nzero (normally *root* user), this will be considered specially and will have a\n*home* mount point with the root of the partition, so it can access to the users\nhome folders for administrative purposses.\n","versions":[{"number":"0.0.0","date":"2014-09-14T16:48:58.866Z"},{"number":"0.0.1","date":"2014-09-16T01:35:07.594Z"},{"number":"0.0.2","date":"2014-09-17T23:54:33.209Z"},{"number":"0.0.3","date":"2014-09-18T00:38:52.074Z"},{"number":"0.0.4","date":"2014-09-18T08:51:23.142Z"},{"number":"0.0.5","date":"2014-09-18T10:47:25.828Z"},{"number":"0.0.6","date":"2014-09-19T01:00:35.495Z"},{"number":"0.0.7","date":"2014-09-19T01:31:58.167Z"},{"number":"0.0.8","date":"2014-09-19T01:44:13.926Z"},{"number":"0.0.9","date":"2014-09-20T21:35:06.260Z"},{"number":"0.0.10","date":"2014-10-17T17:55:24.736Z"},{"number":"0.0.11","date":"2014-10-17T18:05:34.215Z"},{"number":"0.0.12","date":"2014-10-17T18:09:35.906Z"},{"number":"0.0.13","date":"2014-10-21T11:27:13.338Z"},{"number":"0.0.14","date":"2014-11-05T23:56:53.836Z"},{"number":"0.0.15","date":"2015-04-10T19:28:56.656Z"},{"number":"0.0.16","date":"2015-04-10T20:16:12.285Z"},{"number":"1.0.0-RC2","date":"2016-06-22T00:17:53.122Z"},{"number":"1.0.0-RC3","date":"2016-12-17T09:24:04.523Z"},{"number":"1.0.0-RC3.0","date":"2017-01-10T21:58:09.278Z"},{"number":"1.0.0-RC3.1","date":"2017-01-14T23:50:05.833Z"},{"number":"1.0.0-RC3.2","date":"2017-02-18T19:01:24.186Z"}],"created":"2014-09-14T16:48:58.866Z","modified":"2017-04-04T13:09:15.439Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"nodeos","email":"groundwater+nodeos@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"nodeos-bot","email":"pirann.a@gmail.com"},{"name":"piranna","email":"piranna@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"nodeos-usersfs","_nodeVersion":"6.3.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/nodeos-usersfs-1.0.0-RC3.2.tgz_1487444482445_0.6961693111807108"},"_npmUser":{"name":"nodeos","email":"groundwater+nodeos@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.2.0","_rev":"10-0c514c1521c146dc8e14b135883fc615","_shasum":"a7e9b13450ded3c97d92f5634f3f222b8be9648e","author":{"name":"Jesús Leganés Combarro 'piranna'","email":"piranna@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/NodeOS/nodeos-usersfs/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0-RC3.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"a7e9b13450ded3c97d92f5634f3f222b8be9648e","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/nodeos-usersfs/-/nodeos-usersfs-1.0.0-RC3.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"nodeos-bot","email":"pirann.a@gmail.com"},{"name":"piranna","email":"piranna@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-04-04T13:09:15.439Z","created":"2014-09-14T16:48:58.866Z","0.0.0":"2014-09-14T16:48:58.866Z","0.0.1":"2014-09-16T01:35:07.594Z","0.0.2":"2014-09-17T23:54:33.209Z","0.0.3":"2014-09-18T00:38:52.074Z","0.0.4":"2014-09-18T08:51:23.142Z","0.0.5":"2014-09-18T10:47:25.828Z","0.0.6":"2014-09-19T01:00:35.495Z","0.0.7":"2014-09-19T01:31:58.167Z","0.0.8":"2014-09-19T01:44:13.926Z","0.0.9":"2014-09-20T21:35:06.260Z","0.0.10":"2014-10-17T17:55:24.736Z","0.0.11":"2014-10-17T18:05:34.215Z","0.0.12":"2014-10-17T18:09:35.906Z","0.0.13":"2014-10-21T11:27:13.338Z","0.0.14":"2014-11-05T23:56:53.836Z","0.0.15":"2015-04-10T19:28:56.656Z","0.0.16":"2015-04-10T20:16:12.285Z","1.0.0-RC2":"2016-06-22T00:17:53.122Z","1.0.0-RC3":"2016-12-17T09:24:04.523Z","1.0.0-RC3.0":"2017-01-10T21:58:09.278Z","1.0.0-RC3.1":"2017-01-14T23:50:05.833Z","1.0.0-RC3.2":"2017-02-18T19:01:24.186Z"}}}
