Since it is a native (C++) addon, you'll need [everything node-gyp needs](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp#installation) to build projects, which includes Python 2.7 and MS VC++.\r\n\r\n    > npm install winnetinfo\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\n1. `var ni = require('winnetinfo');`\r\n2. `ni.getNetworkParams();`\r\n\r\nYou'll get something like this:\r\n\r\n\t{ hostName: 'daguej',\r\n\t  domainName: '',\r\n\t  dnsServers:\r\n\t   [ '8.8.8.8',\r\n\t\t '8.8.4.4', ],\r\n\t  dnsEnabled: false,\r\n\t  nodeType: 4,\r\n\t  domain: '',\r\n\t  arpProxyEnabled: false,\r\n\t  routingEnabled: false,\r\n\t  dhcpScope: '' }\r\n","created":"2012-10-15T18:17:48.264Z","modified":"2017-05-22T11:08:38.776Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"daguej","email":"daguej@email.uc.edu"},"owners":[{"email":"daguej@email.uc.edu","name":"daguej"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"winnetinfo","_nodeVersion":"4.2.3","_npmUser":{"name":"daguej","email":"daguej@email.uc.edu"},"_npmVersion":"2.14.7","_rev":"2-be9160412216c5c49e0fd79f29d5329c","_shasum":"2759f6d1e7fed9f000c61b9292d80f1e28e59013","author":{"name":"daguej"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/daguej/node-winnetinfo/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"2759f6d1e7fed9f000c61b9292d80f1e28e59013","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/winnetinfo/-/winnetinfo-1.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"email":"daguej@email.uc.edu","name":"daguej"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-05-22T11:08:38.776Z","created":"2012-10-15T18:17:48.264Z","1.0.0":"2012-10-15T18:17:49.619Z","1.0.1":"2015-12-19T20:28:19.861Z"}}}
