SocketCAN is a socket based implementation of the CAN bus protocol for the Linux kernel, developed primarily by VW.\n\n```javascript\nimport * as can from 'rawcan';\n\nconst socket = can.createSocket('vcan0');\n\nsocket.on('error', err => { console.log('socket error: ' + err); });\nsocket.on('message', (id, buffer) => {\n  console.log('received frame [' + id.toString(16) + '] ' + buffer.toString('hex'));\n});\n\nsocket.send(can.EFF_FLAG | 0x23c89f, 'hello');\n```\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nThis package is published to npm, so installing is as simple as:\n\n```\n$ npm install rawcan\n```\n\nTypescript bindings are included, so Typescript should just work.\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nThe workflow is mostly standard for a node addon. There is a native component, so a c++ compiler and make are required. In Ubuntu these dependencies can be installed by running the following in your shell\n\n```\n$ sudo aptitude install build-essential\n```\n\nAfter you have cloned the repo, run the following to install the npm dependencies and build the code:\n\n```\n$ npm install\n$ npm run build\n```\n\nRunning the tests requires a virtual CAN network interface called vcan0.\n\n```\n$ sudo modprobe vcan\n$ sudo ip link add type vcan\n$ sudo ip link set vcan0 up\n```\n\nThen the tests can be run with npm\n\n```\n$ npm test\n```\n\nHow is this different from node-can?\n------------------------------------\n\nThere is another node package for SocketCAN called [node-can](https://github.com/sebi2k1/node-can) (socketcan in npm). The main difference is that node-can is not evented- sends are synchronous and receives are done on a separate thread. By contrast, this package ties into the libuv based node event system, which uses epoll under the hood. node-can also has some messaging features, while this package is strictly a thin wrapper around raw CAN sockets.\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2016-01-11T18:35:35.041Z","modified":"2016-12-15T16:40:25.454Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"jjkr","email":"joe.kramer.cu@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"jjkr","email":"joe.kramer.cu@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"rawcan","_nodeVersion":"5.10.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/rawcan-1.1.4.tgz_1461304887904_0.9487605970352888"},"_npmUser":{"name":"jjkr","email":"joe.kramer.cu@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.8.3","_rev":"2-4194eaed8933fbf55a8a84af17a57d7e","_shasum":"0c258e96ef28656a785c52130efa26778440af83","author":{"name":"Joe Kramer","email":"joe.kramer.cu@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jjkr/rawcan/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.1.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"0c258e96ef28656a785c52130efa26778440af83","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/rawcan/-/rawcan-1.1.4.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"jjkr","email":"joe.kramer.cu@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-12-15T16:40:25.454Z","created":"2016-01-11T18:35:35.041Z","0.1.0":"2016-01-11T18:35:35.041Z","0.1.1":"2016-01-12T00:03:50.068Z","0.1.2":"2016-01-12T19:14:38.237Z","0.1.3":"2016-01-12T19:16:15.214Z","0.1.7":"2016-01-13T21:49:18.243Z","0.1.9":"2016-01-14T18:45:17.980Z","0.1.12":"2016-01-15T05:06:18.329Z","0.1.13":"2016-01-15T05:12:13.117Z","0.1.14":"2016-01-15T05:50:15.506Z","0.1.15":"2016-01-18T18:33:52.153Z","1.0.0":"2016-04-08T20:05:38.161Z","1.1.0":"2016-04-21T19:53:09.414Z","1.1.1":"2016-04-22T03:26:14.461Z","1.1.2":"2016-04-22T03:59:45.854Z","1.1.3":"2016-04-22T05:17:04.761Z","1.1.4":"2016-04-22T06:01:30.348Z"},"users":{"jjkr":true}}}
