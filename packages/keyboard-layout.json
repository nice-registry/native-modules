It returns\nthe string identifier of the current layout based on the value returned by the\noperating system.\n\n```js\nconst KeyboardLayout = require('keyboard-layout')\nKeyboardLayout.getCurrentKeyboardLayout() // => \"com.apple.keylayout.Dvorak\"\n```\n\nIf you want to watch for layout changes, use `onDidChangeCurrentKeyboardLayout`\nor `observeCurrentKeyboardLayout`. They work the same, except\n`observeCurrentKeyboardLayout` invokes the given callback immediately with the\ncurrent layout value and then again next time it changes, whereas\n`onDidChangeCurrentKeyboardLayout` only invokes the callback on the next\nchange.\n\n```js\nconst KeyboardLayout = require('keyboard-layout')\nsubscription = KeyboardLayout.observeCurrentKeyboardLayout((layout) => console.log(layout))\nsubscription.dispose() // to unsubscribe later\n```\n\nTo return characters for various modifier states based on a DOM 3\n`KeyboardEvent.code` value and the current system keyboard layout, use\n`getCurrentKeymap()`:\n\n```js\nconst KeyboardLayout = require('keyboard-layout')\nKeyboardLayout.getCurrentKeymap()['KeyS']\n/*\nOn a US layout, this returns:\n{\n  unmodified: 's',\n  withShift: 'S',\n  withAltGraph: 'ß',\n  withShiftAltGraph: 'Í'\n}\n*/\n```\n","starsCount":2,"created":"2014-09-22T21:20:28.968Z","modified":"2017-07-22T12:03:02.226Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"smashwilson","email":"smashwilson@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"email":"smashwilson@gmail.com","name":"smashwilson"},{"email":"michelle@michelletilley.net","name":"binarymuse"},{"email":"atom@github.com","name":"atom-team"},{"email":"as-cii@github.com","name":"as-cii"},{"email":"maxbrunsfeld@gmail.com","name":"maxbrunsfeld"},{"email":"nathan@github.com","name":"nathansobo"},{"email":"kevinsawicki@gmail.com","name":"kevinsawicki"},{"email":"ogle.ben@gmail.com","name":"benogle"},{"email":"zcbenz@gmail.com","name":"zcbenz"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_id":"keyboard-layout","_nodeVersion":"8.1.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/keyboard-layout-2.0.13.tgz_1499703752753_0.9994972830172628"},"_npmUser":{"name":"smashwilson","email":"smashwilson@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"5.0.4","_rev":"20-c551253fd17b2a5d0a4a8afaf60c98da","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom/keyboard-layout/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"2.0.13"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-WxVc3bBITttHozSyEYPsyr5rN2KQuXtEaXMlQfQjEze1JrkLw30yH/bcNn1IGx48b+tdOdybpnq++JFLU2FaZg==","shasum":"5b4f5c25835e5d221a7b9da897663100d897487d","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/keyboard-layout/-/keyboard-layout-2.0.13.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"email":"smashwilson@gmail.com","name":"smashwilson"},{"email":"michelle@michelletilley.net","name":"binarymuse"},{"email":"atom@github.com","name":"atom-team"},{"email":"as-cii@github.com","name":"as-cii"},{"email":"maxbrunsfeld@gmail.com","name":"maxbrunsfeld"},{"email":"nathan@github.com","name":"nathansobo"},{"email":"kevinsawicki@gmail.com","name":"kevinsawicki"},{"email":"ogle.ben@gmail.com","name":"benogle"},{"email":"zcbenz@gmail.com","name":"zcbenz"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-07-22T12:03:02.226Z","created":"2014-09-22T21:20:28.968Z","0.1.0":"2014-09-22T21:20:28.968Z","0.2.0":"2014-09-22T21:22:02.795Z","0.3.0":"2014-09-22T21:37:56.975Z","0.4.0":"2014-09-22T21:45:03.648Z","0.5.0":"2014-09-23T18:15:44.776Z","0.6.0":"2014-09-23T18:19:27.421Z","0.7.0":"2014-09-24T17:00:05.231Z","0.8.0":"2015-01-02T22:08:27.878Z","0.9.0":"2015-01-13T18:48:37.836Z","0.10.0":"2015-01-28T01:15:45.352Z","0.11.0":"2015-02-20T19:12:07.488Z","0.12.0":"2015-03-04T00:02:52.419Z","1.0.0":"2015-09-14T02:18:09.523Z","1.0.1":"2016-08-15T16:09:32.714Z","1.1.0":"2016-09-13T23:57:48.009Z","1.2.0":"2016-09-15T19:27:38.995Z","1.2.1":"2016-09-16T21:54:38.069Z","1.2.2":"2016-09-16T22:28:22.146Z","1.3.0":"2016-10-14T13:18:12.319Z","1.3.1":"2016-10-17T18:45:58.385Z","2.0.0":"2016-10-17T18:47:19.117Z","2.0.1":"2016-10-24T19:23:13.225Z","2.0.2":"2016-11-10T20:17:35.781Z","2.0.3":"2016-11-20T23:39:26.468Z","2.0.4":"2016-11-21T00:00:02.355Z","2.0.5":"2016-11-21T00:34:43.809Z","2.0.6":"2016-11-21T16:52:41.715Z","2.0.7":"2016-11-23T15:44:37.756Z","2.0.8":"2017-01-04T20:50:07.701Z","2.0.9":"2017-01-05T21:45:19.638Z","2.0.10":"2017-01-06T13:34:15.265Z","2.0.11":"2017-02-13T16:08:17.109Z","2.0.12":"2017-04-12T02:30:25.600Z","2.0.13":"2017-07-10T16:22:33.802Z"},"users":{"donmccurdy":true,"sadovnychyi":true}}}
