This tool improve efficiency of [Node.js Addon](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html) developing, allows developers focus on spec definition and actual implementation codes.\n\nThis bindings code is highly repetitive, primarily passing values (arguments and return values) between V8 and native and doing various conversions and checks (e.g., type checking), hence it is mostly machine-generated.\n\n# Quick Start\n### Init workspace\n```\nnpm init\n```\n### Install widl-nan\n```\nnpm install --save ssh://git@github.com/01org/widl-nan.git\n```\n### Compile your Web IDL\n```\n./node_modules/.bin/widl-nan <your_widl_file>\n```\nCheck Web IDL examples under https://github.com/01org/widl-nan/tree/master/test, basically each supported feature has a test case.\n### (Optional) Init helper files.\n```\n./node_modules/.bin/widl-nan -i\n```\nOr you need write the implementation C++ files, `binding.gyp` and `addon.cpp` from scratch.\n### Build the addon\n```\nnode-gyp rebuild\n```\n\n# Contribution\n\n## Coding style guideline\n\nWe're following [Chromium coding style](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/styleguide/styleguide.md) for different languages: [C++](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/styleguide/c++/c++.md), [Python](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) and [JavaScript](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml). Please run style checker `python ./tools/lint.py` before submitting your code. [depot_tools](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/install-depot-tools) need to be installed and added to `PATH` env.\n\n## Commit message guideline\nA comprehensive commit message will help reviewer to understand what your PR is trying to resolve.
