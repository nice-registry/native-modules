It does not correctly reflect the current CPU usage. (this is also a problem with linux `ps` utility)\n\nBut If you call `usage.lookup()` continuously for a given pid, you can turn on **keepHistory** flag and you'll get the CPU usage since last time you track the usage. This reflects the current CPU usage.\n\nsee following example to enable keepHistory flag\n\n~~~js\nvar pid = process.pid;\nvar options = { keepHistory: true }\nusage.lookup(pid, options, function(err, result) {\n\n});\n~~~\n\nyou can clear history cache too\n~~~js\nusage.clearHistory(pid); //clear history for the given pid\nusage.clearHistory(); //clean history for all pids\n~~~\n","starsCount":8,"created":"2013-02-19T15:30:35.837Z","modified":"2017-03-13T10:06:17.142Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"arunoda","email":"arunoda.susiripala@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"arunoda","email":"arunoda.susiripala@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"usage","_nodeVersion":"0.12.7","_npmUser":{"name":"arunoda","email":"arunoda.susiripala@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.11.3","_rev":"4-c238796770ab383855a7745c82aa2959","_shasum":"25f3106a519550aba41bf6e7685bc9bd533362ff","author":{"name":"Arunoda Susiripala","email":"arunoda.susiripala@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/arunoda/node-usage/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.7.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"25f3106a519550aba41bf6e7685bc9bd533362ff","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/usage/-/usage-0.7.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"arunoda","email":"arunoda.susiripala@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-03-13T10:06:17.142Z","created":"2013-02-19T15:30:35.837Z","0.1.1":"2013-02-19T15:30:41.703Z","0.1.2":"2013-02-19T19:51:12.984Z","0.1.3":"2013-02-19T20:35:08.405Z","0.1.4":"2013-02-20T05:22:30.546Z","0.2.1":"2013-02-21T05:33:14.299Z","0.2.2":"2013-03-03T17:35:14.218Z","0.2.3":"2013-03-03T18:53:44.831Z","0.2.4":"2013-03-03T19:06:53.514Z","0.2.5":"2013-03-04T13:49:37.579Z","0.2.6":"2013-03-04T14:01:02.044Z","0.3.1":"2013-03-20T21:54:54.919Z","0.3.2":"2013-03-21T20:59:16.755Z","0.3.3":"2013-03-23T19:54:42.422Z","0.3.4":"2013-03-24T06:49:47.895Z","0.3.5":"2013-06-23T11:08:02.038Z","0.3.6":"2013-06-27T05:27:15.987Z","0.3.7":"2013-06-28T20:38:56.697Z","0.3.8":"2013-08-02T17:17:58.765Z","0.3.9":"2013-10-08T18:49:10.184Z","0.3.10":"2014-05-14T05:46:00.778Z","0.4.0":"2014-06-08T16:14:12.691Z","0.4.1":"2014-06-08T16:21:05.084Z","0.4.2":"2014-06-17T12:58:56.102Z","0.4.3":"2014-06-18T08:01:22.485Z","0.4.4":"2014-06-29T00:52:34.005Z","0.4.5-bin":"2014-07-03T08:17:44.421Z","0.4.5":"2014-07-03T08:18:25.092Z","0.4.6":"2014-07-03T10:42:15.271Z","0.4.7":"2014-07-03T10:43:23.860Z","0.4.8":"2014-07-03T10:46:46.100Z","0.4.9":"2014-07-03T10:50:32.025Z","0.4.10":"2014-07-03T10:51:12.774Z","0.4.12":"2014-08-12T00:46:59.724Z","0.4.11":"2014-09-04T12:29:20.509Z","0.4.13":"2014-09-04T12:33:01.751Z","0.5.0":"2014-11-01T12:06:12.763Z","0.6.0":"2015-02-16T15:14:46.388Z","0.7.0":"2015-05-05T08:01:37.070Z","0.7.1":"2015-09-09T23:46:35.991Z"},"users":{"humantriangle":true,"dypsilon":true,"f124275809":true,"chiefford":true,"ahme-t":true,"oskaryil":true,"irnnr":true,"bengi":true}}}
