With this addon, you can serialize and parse numbers, booleans, strings, arrays, and objects into the [CBOR](http://cbor.io/) format.\n\n### Performance\n\n`node-tinycbor` is currently slower than the built-in `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()` methods for Array and Object encode/decode. However, `node-tinycbor` is quite fast when compared\nto alternatives such as `node-msgpack`. Benchmarks for `node-tinycbor` can be found [here](http://controlenvy-foss.gitlab.io/node-tinycbor/).\n\n### Usage\n\nThis module provides the four following methods:\n\n* `encode()`, which consumes a JavaScript object and returns an `ArrayBuffer` containing the serialized data\n* `decode()`, which consumes a node `ArrayBuffer` object and returns a JavaScript object identical to the original\n* `toJson()`, which consumes a node `ArrayBuffer` object and writes the JSON representation of said object into a `CBORtoJSON.json` file in the top directory\n* `toText()`, which consumes a node `ArrayBuffer` object and writes the text representation of said object into a `CBORtoTEXT.txt` file in the top directory\n\nFor `toJson()` and `toText()`, if the file is not found, a new one will be generated. Otherwise, the CBOR conversion is appended to the existing file.\n\nEncoding of Strings, Arrays, and Objects of up to length 100,000 is currently supported. Behavior is undefined for objects outside of the specified range.\nEncode/Decode of `null` and `undefined` data types are also supported. \n\nThe below code snippet encodes and then decodes a JavaScript object, verifying\nthe resulting object at the end using `assert.deepEqual()`.\n\n```javascript\n    var assert = require('assert');\n    var CBOR = require('tinycbor');\n\n    var obj = {\"a\" : 1, \"b\" : 2, \"c\" : [1, 2, 3]};\n    var input = CBOR.encode(obj);\n    var output = CBOR.decode(obj);\n\n    assert.deepEqual(output, obj);\n```\n\n### Installation\n\nTo install node-tinycbor, use the following:\n\n## NPM\n\n    npm install tinycbor\n\nThis should allow use of node-tinycbor through `require('tinycbor')`.\n\n## Manually\n\nYou will need node-gyp:\n\n    npm install -g node-gyp\n\nThen from the root of the tinycbor repo, you can run:\n\n    node-gyp rebuild\n\n<dl>\n  <dt>NOTE:</dt>\n  <dd>\n    node-gyp attempts to contact the Internet and download the target version\n    of node.js source and store it locally.  This will only happen once for\n    each time it sees a new node.js version.  If you're on a host with no\n    direct Internet access, you may need to shuffle this source over from\n    another box or sneaker net.  Good luck!\n  </dd>\n</dl>\n","created":"2017-06-15T19:08:48.129Z","modified":"2017-08-15T16:36:29.736Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"samuelvpatterson","email":"samuelvpatterson@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"samuelvpatterson","email":"samuelvpatterson@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"tinycbor","_nodeVersion":"6.11.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/tinycbor-0.2.1.tgz_1502814988159_0.7114392251241952"},"_npmUser":{"name":"samuelvpatterson","email":"samuelvpatterson@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.10","_rev":"18-13442fa93984bd27108bb31202991d11","_shasum":"ccb3f8b709c630a3414902920b301d41a719b69f","author":{"name":"Samuel Patterson"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.2.1","redis":"0.1.4"},"dist":{"shasum":"ccb3f8b709c630a3414902920b301d41a719b69f","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/tinycbor/-/tinycbor-0.2.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"samuelvpatterson","email":"samuelvpatterson@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-08-15T16:36:29.736Z","created":"2017-06-15T19:08:48.129Z","0.0.1":"2017-06-15T19:08:48.129Z","0.0.3":"2017-06-15T19:57:10.848Z","0.0.4":"2017-06-16T06:55:24.893Z","0.0.5":"2017-06-16T07:07:09.036Z","0.0.6":"2017-06-19T19:42:13.858Z","0.0.7":"2017-06-19T19:53:50.409Z","0.0.8":"2017-06-20T23:17:05.447Z","0.0.9":"2017-06-20T23:27:54.505Z","0.0.10":"2017-06-21T17:07:11.484Z","0.0.11":"2017-07-03T20:57:56.864Z","0.1.0":"2017-08-01T18:35:44.033Z","0.1.1":"2017-08-01T22:32:19.697Z","0.1.2":"2017-08-01T22:47:27.472Z","0.1.3":"2017-08-02T16:48:47.371Z","0.1.4":"2017-08-03T15:57:02.056Z","0.2.0":"2017-08-12T00:06:57.603Z","0.2.1":"2017-08-15T16:36:29.736Z"}}}
