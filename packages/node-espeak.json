This will be passed to the ```setVoice()``` method.\n\nYou may also specify an object containing additional properties which will be passed to ```setProperties()```.\n\n### speak(text)\n\nWill synthesize the given text. The synthesized audio will be passed to the function you specified with the ```onVoice()``` method.\n\n### onVoice(callback)\n\nWill set the callback to call whenever speech was synthesized.\n\nThe callback should have three parameters:\n\n* **data**: The raw audio samples.\n* **samplerate**: The sample rate.\n* **samples**: The amount of samples generated.\n\n### getVoice()\n\nReturns an object containing information about the voice eSpeak is using.\nThe object will contain the following properties:\n\n* **gender**: \"male\", \"female\" or \"none\".\n* **language**: The two letter code of the language currently used.\n* **age**: The age of the voice.\n* **variant**: The variant of the voice eSpeak is using.\n\n### getProperties()\n\nReturns an object containing the current properties of eSpeak.\nThe object will contain the following properties:\n\n* **pitch**: The pitch. Values from 0 to 100.\n* **volume**: The current volume. Values from 0 to 200 or higher.\n* **range**: The range. 0 is totally monotonous, default is 50 and maximum is 100.\n* **rate**: The speed the voice will be played back in words per minute. Valus from 80 to 450.\n* **gap**: The gap between the words in 10ms (at normal rate).\n\n### setProperties(properties)\n\nWill set the additional properties. This method takes an object as argument in the form of the object specified in ```getProperties()```.\nYou may also only specify some of the properties.\n\n\n### setVoice(voice)\n\nSets the voice to use. See the object defined in ```getVoice()``` for additional information about the object to pass to this method.\nYou may also only specify some of the properties.\n\n\nYou can also set each property and option for the voice with one of the following seperate setters:\n\n* setPitch(pitch)\n* setVolume(volume)\n* setRange(range)\n* setRate(rate)\n* setGap(gap)\n* setAge(age)\n* setLanguage(language)\n* setVariant(variant)\n* setGender(gender)\n\nLicense\n-------\nThis project is published under the terms of version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n","starsCount":3,"created":"2015-04-30T07:16:35.920Z","modified":"2016-11-28T03:39:33.593Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"prior99","email":"frederick@gnodtke.net"},"owners":[{"name":"prior99","email":"frederick@gnodtke.net"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"node-espeak","_nodeVersion":"6.3.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-16-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/node-espeak-0.2.1.tgz_1476869325094_0.1688576687593013"},"_npmUser":{"name":"prior99","email":"frederick@gnodtke.net"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.3","_rev":"2-672c2d0e03afd9063949c69d711717c4","_shasum":"3edd47ebd0c46804086af5a633716083475de1a9","author":{"name":"Frederick Gnodtke"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/Prior99/node-espeak/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.2.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"3edd47ebd0c46804086af5a633716083475de1a9","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/node-espeak/-/node-espeak-0.2.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"prior99","email":"frederick@gnodtke.net"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-11-28T03:39:33.593Z","created":"2015-04-30T07:16:35.920Z","0.0.0":"2015-04-30T07:16:35.920Z","0.1.0":"2015-04-30T07:24:56.730Z","0.1.1":"2015-04-30T07:59:06.950Z","0.1.2":"2015-04-30T19:19:31.249Z","0.1.3":"2015-04-30T20:06:11.556Z","0.1.4":"2015-05-03T12:31:58.629Z","0.1.5":"2015-05-03T14:26:58.321Z","0.2.0":"2015-12-23T15:52:39.240Z","0.2.1":"2016-10-19T09:28:45.738Z"},"users":{"dosevader":true,"aztlan2k":true,"mbrav":true}}}
