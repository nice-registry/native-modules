This shows off how one can leverage the power (and stability) of Rust to write the core functionality for a plugin.\n\n## Using\nTo install this plugin just do a normal plugin install:\n\n```\n$ heroku plugins:install heroku-cli-neon-hello-world\n```\n\n## Local development\n\n### Native Extensions\nIn order for users to not need to know about Rust underneath, it uses [node-pre-gyp](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon) to compile the binaries. It uses TravisCI to compile the 64-bit Linux/OSX binaries, CircleCI to handle the 32-bit binaries, and Appveyor for the 32/64-bit Windows binaries.\n\nThe `binding.gyp` file calls `neon build` to compile the native extension as well as move `index.node` into `lib` so it can be found.\n\n### Building\nMake sure you have `neon-cli`, `node-pre-gyp` installed:\n\n```\n$ npm install -g neon-cli node-pre-gyp\n```\n\nTo build just do a normal `yarn install`:\n\n```\n$ yarn install\n```\n\nIn order to use this with the heroku CLI, you'll need to [link it](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/developing-cli-plugins#installing-the-plugin):\n\n```\n$ heroku plugins:link\n```\n","created":"2017-08-20T20:33:18.298Z","modified":"2017-08-20T20:33:18.298Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"hone","email":"hone02@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"hone","email":"hone02@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"heroku-cli-neon-hello-world","_nodeVersion":"8.3.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/heroku-cli-neon-hello-world-0.1.0.tgz_1503261196509_0.6020633338484913"},"_npmUser":{"name":"hone","email":"hone02@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.5.0","_rev":"1-9c7dda8dd8ac6b44ea8af0ae00b5904c","_shasum":"c7185fe2d215799465175106390fc16094603860","author":{"name":"Terence Lee","email":"hone02@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/hone/heroku-cli-neon-hello-world/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.1.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"c7185fe2d215799465175106390fc16094603860","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/heroku-cli-neon-hello-world/-/heroku-cli-neon-hello-world-0.1.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"hone","email":"hone02@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-08-20T20:33:18.298Z","created":"2017-08-20T20:33:18.298Z","0.1.0":"2017-08-20T20:33:18.298Z"}}}
